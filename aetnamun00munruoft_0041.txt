favourite, notwithstanding a protest from Markland, inclined even to
underrate the merit and age of the poem, who declared with reason that
there was no resemblance between its style and that of the undoubted
remains of Severus. In truth the longest fragment, that of 25 verses on
the death of Cicero preserved by the elder Seneca, has an Ovidi-an
fulness and clasticity and easy fiow which we ,look for in vain in any
part of our poem. His friend Ovid addresses him as the ‘uates mag-
norum maxime regum’, and Quintilian, x 1 89, says that, though he
is a better versifier than poet, yet if the whole of his ‘bellum Siculum '
had been written like the first book, 116 would have justly claimed
the second place among Roman heroic poets, above Ovid himself.
There is no doubt that the Italian scholar who first assigned the poem
to Severus, was led to do so solely through a passage in the 79th
epistle of Seneca, where he is speaking of his friend Lucilius’ intention
to describe Etna in his poem, ‘hunc sollemnem omnibus poetis locum’:
‘quem quominus Ouidius tractaret nihil obstitit quod iam Vergilius
impleuerat: ne Seuerum quidem Cornelium uterque deterruit'. But
the natural meaning of Seneca's words, as Wernsdorf has seen, is that
Severus had inserted in his ‘bellum Siculum’ a short episode about
Etna, as Virgil had don-e in his Aeneicl and Ovid in his metamorphoses.
This passage therefore is by no means in favour of his claims, as our
poem forms a distinct and complete whole. These very words of
Seneca however led YVernsdorf, and have since induced Jacob and
many others to maintain unhesitatingly that Lucilius himself is the
author: with what truth we have next to examine. For the sole
purpose of throwing some light on this question I have read through the
whole of Seneca's letters. The results obtained I had intended at first
to state at some length3 but I have since come to the conclusion that
the matter is not important enough for this 3 and I have accordingly
compressed what I have to say into as brief a space as possible.

In his 2lst epistle Seneca says ‘quod Epicurus amico suo potuit
promittere, hoc tibi promitto, Lucili: habebo apud posteros gratiam,
possum mecum duratura nomina educere’ 3 and he has kept his word:
but for Seneca‘s writings the name of Lucilius would have been unknown
to us. As it is, we see him in a great variety of aspects3 for to him are
addressed the whole of Seneca's letters, the first book of the dialogucs,
and the seven books of naturales quaestiones, in all much more than
half his extant works. From these various sources we leam much about
Lucilius: his cognomen was Iunior, he was procurator of Sicily during
the whole time that Seneca corresponded with him ς of humble birth he
had raised himself to this place by his own merits: ‘ in medium te pro-
tulit ingenii vigor, scriptorum elegantia, clarae et nobiles amicitiae’.
He had seen much service, had crossed the Great and Little St Bernard
