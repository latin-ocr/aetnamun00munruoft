this cause, i. e. a conflagration among the materials in the mountain,
must be waited for, before the wind or spiritus 000 perform its func-
tions: but so soon as there shall be this conflagmtion, then the wind
will do its part: in 213 when the t of iwflabit was changed to s, as just
above in operit, and 165 in acuat, it easily became inflatis: acre for aer
seems quite necessary. Read Scaliger and Jacob to see what they make
of these vss. 214 flammae of β 500015 necessary for the sense: here
too it is hard to account for the semper of α. ω, and prope par, which
must mean semper prope par, would be the better sor that word. 21¹7
mulie of α. ω 15 surely better than audet of β. 218 my slight correc-
tions 11010 seem quite necessary. With Lucretius too this spiritus, aer
or uentus plays an equally important: part in the eruptions of Etna.
219—305: we have now 10 explain the different causes which pro-
duce the winds: it is a godlike pleasure to inquire into the origin of 1110
world ; to learn the nature and courses of the sun, the moon and stars ;
why 1110 50050115 change and the like. Yet surely we lords of the earth
have more concern with the things of this earth: Ι (10 1101 mean, so far
as they bring us gain by mining, by tilling and the like: we have 10 in-
vestigate its phenomena, for instance these very winds which stir the
fires of Etna: they have many causeS‚ some arising above ground3 such .

born in like ways under the ground. 219 11115 line resembles several
in Lucretius, whom our poet frequently imitates. 220 sint, and 221
sic arc understood: comp. 243 and 0. 10 91. quae 001. ‘which is what
feeds the fires': here too β alone gives sense. 224 tueri is another
splendid gain from β; 11 and the other infinitives down to 250 depend on
voluptas est there. 225 effusis i. e. nobis: the dat. seems quite defen-
sible. 227 both sense and poetry declare that β 15 right here: α and ω
give ari-ant nonsense. 228 here α bears the palm: principia must be
joined with what precedes. quot: one, two, three, or four, or, as the
epicureans say, infinite. qnaezqmclc'a: so 243 quae—quae. 229 I
have not changed the indicatives here, nor in 230, 239, 240, as two of
these instances could not be altered without violent and quite improba-
ble correction: Propertius has many similar indicative& I do not know
whether our author intended them to be as it were parenthetical: in
272 Ι have written quod for quid, as quid coercet seems intolerable.
saecula: ‘for ever': a common sense in the poets. 231 by reading
ut, for et I have I think made clear this and the foll. V. which can-
nothe understood in any edition: scire modum solis3 50110 qua ratione
luna, quanto minor eius orbita est, eo breuior cet. ε how the moon makes
twelve‚ while the sun makes one revolution: the constr. is like that of
241 foll. ‘nosse cometen, Lucifer unde cet) 234 here I cannot with
any certainty mediate between α ω, 00(1 β; β looks to me interpolated:
