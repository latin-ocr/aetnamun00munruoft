41—73: another fable is the burial of Enceladus under Etna‚ after
the war of the giants with the gods. 41 Proxima cet.: ‘the next
and third legend sets in motion the quick fires of Etna's top by means
of the camp of Phlegra': they are the consequence that is of the battle

of the Phlegrean fields. 43 mzmdo, the upper world: a sense so
common in Lucretius, Manilius and indeed most poets: so below,
55 mundum, 63 and 247 mundo, 70 mundi. 44 sidera: they being

the allies of the gods: comp. 51, 53 and 69 70: but above he was
speaking in his own person, here in the person of these fable-mon-
gers. 46 sua est: they have their proper, i. e. a man's shape, down
to the be11y3 below they are sei-petits: Ovid calls them (zicyuipetles and
serpentipedes. 53 the end of this v. is found only in a: tertia of α.
seems to have come from tretia i. e. trementia: the poet seems to have
been thinking of Lucr. 111 834 ‘belli trepido concussa tumultu Horrida
contremuere sub altis aetheris oris’ 3 and Catull. LXIV 205 ‘ tellus atque
horrida contremuerunt Aequora concussitque micantia sidera mundus':
the adm. trem. 3²⁶9· repeat-s with additional emphasis the metuentia com-
minus of 51 : the author as a stoic held the stars to be gods, and so joins
the &anctos diuos, the gods one and all and with them the stars eto:
comp. Lucr. v 115 foll. and my note to 116 and 117, where Lucretius is -
evidently arguing against a stoical allegorising of the wars of the gods
and giants: comp. too vv. 69 70 and what I say there. ‘The impious
soldiery challenge at close quarters the frightened stars: challenge I say
in hostile arra-y the gods one and all and the constellations shaking as
the standards are brought into the battle’: comp. too Manil. 1 427 ‘Et
tam uicinos fugientia sidera', and what precedes and follows 3 Claudiai]
gigantom. 9 ‘Pallescunt subito stellae'3 and Horace's ‘Telluris iuuenes
unde periculum Fulgens contremuit domus Saturni ueteris'. 54 e
caelo of mss. has no suitable meaning, as Jupiter fears, not for himself,
but for the safety of heaven: en seems to have more than once the same
force in Lucan, probably a contemporary 3 see Hand Turs. 11 p. 370 who
cites v 37 ‘en totis uiribus orbis Hesperiam pensant superi’. caelo
metuit: Sen. Hippol. 1136 ‘Metuens caelo Iuppiter alto Vicina petit’.
(least. cor. cet.: Virg. geor. 1 328 ‘ Ipse pater...corusca Fulmina molitur
dextra': his editors cite Son. Hipp. 156 ‘Vibrans corusca fulmen
Aetnaeum manu'. 55 rem. cal. mma XVernsdors well illustrates by
Ovid fasti Π 493 ‘ Sol fugit et remouent subeuntia nubila caelum’: ‘he
withdraws the sky from sight by thick darkness’. 58 discor-dei is
perhaps indicated by the discordes of mss: 547 soi-tei: sorte αὸζτ
576 piei: piis αὸζ, pio γε; 624 pieis: dees um: 138 αω have nocti,
β has noete, perhaps noctez' is right. I gladly retain any vestiges of
the older spelling, as at the date of our poem there evidently were
different schools, some grammarians keeping more to older, some to more
