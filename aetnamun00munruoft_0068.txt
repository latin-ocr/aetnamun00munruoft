to such an instrument as Claudius' Triton 011 lake Fucinus which gave

it in motion: just as the water of the clouds impels the winds which put

is so called I do not know, whether from its shape resembling somehow
a pot, or else the sacred pot and tripod 011 which the Pythia sat3 or, as
&Vernsdorf poet. min. 11 p. 398 suggests, from the loud noise Which came
forth from the Delphic cortina causing thc name to be transferred to

here in this sense, the meaning is uncertain: the box containing the
water would seem from coins and gems to have been of different shapes 3
