recent forms. From Quintilian 0110 would infer that many forms had
gone out of use, which the best 11155. of the elder Pliny, Juvenal and
others shew to have been employed by their respective authors: thus
too in 625 Ι keep the nom. plur. fortis, 594 rorantis, aud 3582101611-
tis, the best mss. of Pliny often giving this form: 134 Ι write decussis,

60 foll. : this passage is intelligible in α 310110, 60 being much muti-
lated and 61 altogether wanting in all other mss, 62 scaemcs of ε for
saeuus of other mss. is right: but in ε it is Ι believe a pure accident, as

not quite so probable: our poet seems fond of Greek words, as I have
observed elsewhere. 61 uenit, 62 erat„ 63 stant: this mixture of the
narrative present with a past tense is not uncommon in the best writers:
comp. just belom 69 est reddita, 70 cessat, uenit: Livy V 49 7 ‘dictator
—redit—appellabatur': appell. being a colourless word like crat in our
passage, so that the present would have no force: Aen. 1v 228 ‘promisit
—uindicat’z Caesar bell. 0111. 1 14 4 ‘confirmat—iussit'. 63 deus:
the interpolated metus has no more meaning than authority 3 but deus
too cannot be right: the qod Jupiter in opposition to the 50115 of Earth
would be too perverse a point even for our poet. 64 uictor of γ ε Ι

right: Ovid. met. Ι 154 has ‘misso perfregit Olympum Fulmine’ of the

vanquished as they lay prostrate’: mother Earth is carried along in the
common ruin as she vainly tries to rally them: with the two participles

follow a, without changing a letter: the passage is quite unintelligible in
all editions from wrong stopping and the fact that cessat is corrupted in
ωε the passage is obscure: ‘then peace was restored to the sky, which
then was free and at rest: this peace came by the help of the stars:
heaven and the honour of the sky's clefence are now assigned to the
stars’. As a stoic (see what was said above and Lucretius there referred
to) he brings the stars into prominence‚ and mixes them up with the
vulgar fable. Earth and her children scaled the sky, and the stars being
in sront of J upiter and the gods bore the first brunt of the attack, as im—
plied in 51—53: this first gave them admission to heaven, as a recom-
pense for defending the sky: if uenit, i.e. pax, be thought too harsh even
