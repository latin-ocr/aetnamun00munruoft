have introduced from it into the body of my edition only one emenda·
tion, testem for pestem in 449, which Ι had left uncorreeted: to the rest
of the program Ι have devoted a separate appendix. The learned and
accomplished critic has had the ill-luck to get a most inaccurate cellation
of α..

Τ116 manuscripts which I denote by α, β, γ, 8, ε, ζ respectively have
been fully described above: as I have already said, the Ininutest varia-
tions of α. have been recorded 3 as well as the readings of the lost frag-
ment β, so far as a comparison of the two authorities on which Ι had to
rely permitted this to be done: where it did not seem ‚worth while to
give in detail the variations of γ, ὃ, ε and ζ, ω denotes either all of these,
together with the editions before Aldus so far as they were known to me,
unless any of these mss. are especially excepted 3 or else the general con—
sensus of the best and most important of them: 5· designates some or all
of the later and worse of these inferior mss. and editions: Ed denotes
the present editor.

1-8: the poet calls on Apollo and the muses to inspire him in
singing of Aetna. 1 seems to be a reminiscence both of Lucr. vl 202 ·
‘rotantque cauis flammam fornacibus intus’‚ 681 ‘ Flamma foras uastis
Aetnae fornacibus effiet', and of Virgil's ‘ undantem ruptis fornacibus
Aetnam'. ‘rupti iquos: so 59 ‘ per attonitas rumpuntur fulmina nubes' 3
201 ‘ fragor tota 1111116 rumpitur Aetna' 3 362 ‘flammas ac fulmina rum-
punt’, 393 ‘fontes Infectae rumpuntur aquae’: so Gratius cyneg. 432
‘ ruptique ambustis faucibus amnes'3 Stat. Theb. XII 275 ‘rupto igni'‚
both speaking of Aetna: Lucr. 11:214 ‘abrupti nubibus ignes', with
which Macrobius compares Aen. 111 199 ‘ abruptis nubibus ignes’ where
Ribbeck's G has abrupti, BIacrobius giving abruptis to Lueretius.
3 Quid, i. e. ‘why’‚ of ο. ω is better than the Quod of all editions: Cic.
Cato 51 ‘habent enim rationem cum terra quae numquam recusat impe-
rium': comp. Aen. 1 54 ‘Imperio premit...Illi...Circum claustra fre-
munt'. 4 and 8 Phoebo duce: he imitatos the culex 12 ‘Phoebus
erit nostri princeps et carminis auetor’. The omission of the vocative is
harsh, but it is to be got out of Phoebo (memte, Phoebe, duce: the
interpolatcd mss. and editions give ‘dexter mihi carminis auctor, Apollo'.
5 Delo-et: delos α ω z the enclitic st is a continual source of this and like
corruptions in mss: I account in the same way for many corruptions in
our poem: 604 Ι have written Q'fflzist: ignis α ω; 96 ec solalumsc: ct
solido α, et solidum γ ω; the corruption arose out of et solidasc: 139
‘ruinascz minas β, ruinae (i. e. ruina. ἒ.) α. ωε 194 operist: operi est β,
operum est (i. c. operi-ist) α ως 231 Zunaest: luna est α. ω : lunae est β γ Z:
348 ruimoest : ruinis α. ωε 353 in temeist: in tenui α, ω, tenuis ζ 5· : 470
