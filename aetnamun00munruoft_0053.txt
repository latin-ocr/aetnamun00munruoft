of Catullus LXIV 57 60 132-135 247. 23 here again there must be
a hiatus, and Ι believe of the kind indicated in my text: the eye of the
copyist wandered from the middle of one v, to the same part of the next:
this would give the sense needed, ‘ Quicquid in antiqu [o narratur tempore
gestum (or ‘gestum est memorabile saeclo' or the like), Omnis per
uari]um iactata est fabula carmen’: Nemesian. 46 seems to be again
imitating our poem: ‘Haec iam magnorum praecepit copia uatum,
Omnis et antiqui uulgata est fabula saecli’ z icaetata est z uulgata est.

24 iynotas curas are the noua, uota, and the insolitzom of 7 and 8.

. curas: comp. Tacitus ann. 111 24 ‘si effectis in quae tetendi, plures

ad curas uitam produxero'. 25 operi: Etna and its fireS, as ex-
plained 111 l. 25 26 as neither tanta nor densum has any substan-
tive, a V. is clearly lost such as ‘ quae tanta perenni [Impete uis subter
glomerans incendia, nimbum] Explicet in densum flammas’: with this
and what follows comp. Claud. rapt. Proserp. 1161 ‘Nunc uomit
indigenas nimbos piceaque granatum Foedat nube diem 3 nunc molibus
astra lacessit Terrificis damnisque suis incendia nutrit ...... Quae scopulos
tormenta rotant? quae tanta procellas Vis glomerat? quo fonte ruit
Vulcanius amnis2' 27 moles: 200 ‘Flagrantes properant moles’3
467 ‘Accensae subeunt moles'. 28 irriguis: the molten lava being
the chief feature of the eruption.

29—40: do not believe with the poets either that Vulcan at his
work causes this fire, or the Cyclopes in forging thunder. 30 dei, i. e.
Vulcan. 31 Vulc. rw: comp. the last V. of Claudian quoted above.
33 eat-tremas: infimas: a sense which F orcell. s.V. illustrates. 34 Si-
dera here as elsewhere are made coordinate with the gods: comp. 44,
51, 53, 68 69 70: as said above p. 35 36, it is clear from this and other
passages that the poet was a stoic: the stars exercise a general super-
intendence over the earth, but scorn all trivia] interference. sub.
req. subl. caelo: comp. Sen. de ben. IV 23 4 ‘paucorum motus compre-
hendimus, innumerabiles uero longiusque a conspectu nostro seducti
di eunt redeuntque ’. 36 Discrepcoc cet: the difference, as Scaliger
explains, is this: the former inculcate a superstitious dread of a divine
interposition in human affairs: the latter propagate a mere mythological
falsehood. 38 numerosa expresses Virgil's ‘bracchia tollunt In nu-
merum’. 40 Jacob's et for est of mss, seems quite necessary. piq-
‘noret the word recurs in this sense in 135 pz‘ynera3 460 piynora
flammae ; 519 ‘certo uerum tibi pignore constat': so Gratius cyneg.
240 ‘ne prima fauentem pignora fallant' 3 255 ‘ad pignora Martis’3
263 ‘maiorum pignore signa F etumm’ 3 300 ‘ Nec me pignoribus nec te
mea carmina fallent': twice in our poem σ. has o; once, 135, piss-
nera, which Priscian and the best mss, shew to have been in common
use: the verb was piynero.
