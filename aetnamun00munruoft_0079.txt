uum is neut. as nerto, conuerto, muto, and the like often are 5 comp. 168
‘turbare'z I do not elsewhere find the finite verb so used, but the
partic. uoluens is neuter in Lucretius, virgil, Ovid and others. ewamina:
504 ‘Emicat examen'3 Lucr. V 1364 ‘pullorum examina'. 469 470,
found in α. only, give sense to a passage before unintelligible: he speaks
of the confusion among men suddenly overtaken by the eruption, some
running, some overcome‚ some struck by stenes, some caught by the
lava, and compares it with a battle: Aetna being the conqueror and
strewing the field with the bodies of the slain up to the very rampart of
their camp: there is a ourious precision and technicality in the account,
implying, as we have said before, that the writer had seen an eruption:
comp. 465: and had also had personal experience of fields of battle: he
is fond too of carrying out this metaphor of a battle and an enemy in
regard to Etna and its operations: comp. 552 and 612. 470 471 my
changes are very slight here: recipit seems to mean ‘one does not stay
to meet’3 another is exhausted and cannot fly. 474 acics ‘the enemy's
line’. castra cet.: he has been chased and slaughtered up to the gates
of his camp.

475 foll. : here too there is an abruptness‚ almost helplessness of ex-
position, such as we find in some other parts of the poem: the text is
I believe essentially sound: the author in 475-477 explains the con-
dition of a lapis molaris, when caught in the fire by itself: 478--483
Eaecutitur, the condition to which a heap of those stones is reduced:
then 483 foll. the molten stream of lava. 475 summo: maximo.

476 the corrupt sopitaes I cannot emend with any certainty: it may
come from species (spetiaes) which gives a sense, and is more like to
it than Scaliger’s scabres. faex of σ. is a great gain: the word seems to
have got by accident into Gorallus’ edition and from it into XVernsdorf's:
Sen. epist. 94 58 ‘nihil est illis, dum fiunt et a faece sua separantur,
inf01·mius...Sterile terrae genus et infernum perpurgatur’. 477 cer-
nas I prefer to cernis of other editors: see n. to 307 credas. 478 but
when a heap is formed of these falling stones, it will be broad at the base
and narrower at the top, so that the stones will burn away to a cinder
as if they were in a kiln. 479 any. uer. sun: the heap would
naturally assume more or less this conical shape, from the mode in which
they would fall. 480 fornace is a very general term: here it clearly
means a fornax calcaria or limekiln, fully described by Cato de re rust.
38: his proportions are 10 feet broad at bottom, 3 at top, 20 high ; and
hence we get a good notion of how a heap of these stones would go on
burning till reduced to cinders, after the loss of the part that turns
liquid: on the ueluti in of mss. see my critical notes to Lucr. 11 322 and
536. 482 pumex: see 423 and n. there. 483 liquor ille cet.: he
now proceeds to describe the lava stream: liquor ille refers back to
