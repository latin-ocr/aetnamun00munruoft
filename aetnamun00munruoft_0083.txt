521 robow, his favourite word: with its real substance intact: my slight
corrections and my punctuation here seem to give the sense required.
522 Vtraque I read for Vlcraque, a slight and Ι think necessary change:
‘in both cases' 1,6. both fused and solid: it answers to the ‘ seu forte
madentes cet.' of the next v. ε the word is thrice used by Lucretius in the
same way, 1v 86, 291, V1 517: Vtramque of γ ε 5· and editions has no
meaning. 523 tenet is not neut. as Scaliger says: ‘ tenet conseruatque
notas' are joined. 526—528 Ι do not profess to explain: color ipse
seems to refer to the same fact as 427 ‘ certissima signa coloris’: colour is
the great test of the true molaris: Ι should therefore have put the sign of 3.
13011113, if I could have explained the rest satisfactorily, as externam can
hardly agree with notam. 529 too seems to me to point to a lacuna
after 52 6: I don‘t deny, he sayS, that certain other stenes do burn
fiercely5 but they cannot be fused into lava like the molaris. 530
propria uirtus = proprietas eff 513. 532 fridicas a: a Greek word is
wanted with something like the sense offusilis 3 Scaliger therefore con-
jectures ckytas or rhytas: if α 13 nearer, as it probably is, than the other
mss. to what we want, the f]- may come from the preceding -ere; and
idicens may represent Icyclicas or some such provincial word. 533 illa,
saxa. 535 commissa: metaph. from matching two things against each
other: ‘nor will those stenes have been properly matched against the
structure of the molaris in their inner substance ’. γ

536—564: the fusing of this stone need not excite surprise: the
hardest metals melt in the fire3 and you may test the truth yourself :
expose the stone to a moderate fire in the open air: it will resist: put it
in a hot closed furnace, and it will melt: think now how much greater
the heat is to which it is exposed when pent up within the furnaces of
Etna. 538 Ι adopt Scaliger's ab iyni for yiyni, and quo for quae3
though perhaps there is a lacuna such as this: ‘ nihil insuperabile gigni
[Ignibus, et contra procrescere rursus ab igni] omnia quae cet.': Hera-
clitus flag. 41 Schleier. πυρός σῖνταμείβεται πάντα καὶ πῦρ ἁπάντων cet:
an epicurean could not have spoken, as our author here speaks, of Hera-
clitus, nor have grounded his own reasom'ng on a principle of his,
540 we have a similar question, and answer appended without any con-
necting particle in 599 ‘Haec uisenda cet.': no change is needed: ‘ but
after all is this so very strange2 why, the hardest bodies ete.': nim, mir.
with a question=non nimis mirum. 542 comp. Lucr. 1 493 ‘Tum
glacies aeris flamma deuicta liquescit’3 for this passage is an imitation,
perhaps unconscious, of this part of Lucretiu83 for the form of expres-
sion comp. Lucr. v 306 foll. animos: so 405 ‘ extorquere animos’ of his
stone: it= robur. 543 lenticies seems to occur here only 3 even lenti-
tia is of the silver age, lentitudo being the older form: here it means
‘toughness': so lentus is said of amentum, radix, and the like: plum-
