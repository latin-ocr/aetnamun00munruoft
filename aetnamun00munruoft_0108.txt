The popularity of the ‘ Books for Young Readers ' is a. sufficient proof tha
teachers aud pupils alike approve of the use of interesting stories, in place of
the dry combination of letters and syllables, of which elementary reading-books
generally consist. The Publishers have therefore thought it advisable to extend
the application of thjs principle to books adapted for more advanced readers.
