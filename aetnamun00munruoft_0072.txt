understand Aen. IV 130 ‘iubare exorto’. 335 Pigsra—ltzcmida: these
two epithets referring to nubes cannot be right: again the cloud over
Etna was the reverse of ‘wet’z it was dry and like smoke: Strabo
p. 272 shews this and illustrates the whole passage: ὑπὲρ δὲ τοῦ βουνοῦ
νέφας ὄρθιον διανεστηκός εἰς ὕψος ὅσον διακοσίων ποδῶν η’ρεμοῦν (εἶναι γάρ
νηνεμίαν) εἰκάζειν δὲ καπνῷῑ Ι propose circumstupet (timida, or anormala,

is the Latin sorni of ἀτμίς, which well represents Strabo’s εἰκάζειν δὲ
καπνῶ, and his α’χλύν ὁμιχλώδη in p. 276 where he speaks of the volcanic
Hiera. In the old language, when the people adapted Greek words to
their own organs of speech, we find such words as placenta, turunda,
amphora, adapted to the lst decl. from the accus. of the Greek forms:
this mode of adaptation seems never to have been lost3 thus on one side
of our poet we find in Virgil and Propertius the nomin. cassida instead
of cassis, said to be an Etruscan word3 and on the other we have
Apuleius more than onee using σῖιῖαηιςμῖαῐχλαμύς. circumstupeb: 342
‘stupeatque profundum’: the proper force of the word seems to be ‘fixed

immoveable in astonishment’. 336 Prosp. sabb: 200 ft. above the.

that froin this and what precedes and follows the furious winds cannot
be rushing in, in order to be afterwards driven out again in the erup-

the crater: lSl ‘Hine uasti terrent aditus cet.’3 336 ‘uastosque recep-

cano Aetna sacer’: so Ossa and Oeta in Ovid and others3 though he and
others make them femin. also: it would appear that the masc. eomes
from mons understood: mons Iura, mons Cevenna, and in Pliny ‘mons

Aetna are found with a masc. epithet. 341 tan. sem. rer. ‘ the canses

lSl ‘merguntque profundo’. 343 the rest of this paragraph is among

the obscurest of the poem, owing partly to the harsh abruptness of the
writer on difficult questions, partly to the imperfection of his mss. I have
however adhered to α, making only the slightest changes, but noting
below two lacunae3 whereas editors from Scaliger to Wcrnsdorf have
violently altered nearly every V. and after all their texts are simply
unintelligible. IIm‘e cet. I take to mean: do you trust to this, the fact
of this great calm at the top of Etna to refute such theory? ut: I am
tempted to read ab: but I explain ub as an emphatic assei-tion: how in
