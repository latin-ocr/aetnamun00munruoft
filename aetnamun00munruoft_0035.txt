even where most wrong, is always suggestive. Thi-oughout the work
there breathes that original freshness which makes it as lively and plea-

At the close of the Aetna he says his whole ‘Appendix' was composed

he gave to our poem. But his energy looks almost superhuman, and his

Scaliger long held undisputed sway, until in 1703 the well-known
John Leclerc decided that the time had come for a new recension and
published his prolix edition under the assumed name of Theodorus
Gorallus, which gives a Greek equivalent for the HebreW, a Hebrew for the
Greek part of his name Ioannes Clericus.> He clearly meant it to advance
his claims to universal excellence: with this view 116 13 glad enough to
find Scaliger, whose notes he prints at length, in the wrong3 but I do
not detect any more unworthy motive in his fault-findingg and the form
of his book gives the reader ample opportunity of seeing how unequal
he is to his predecessor. Yet he is a man of sound sense and extensive
erudition: his interpretatio indeed is precise enough where the original

Wernsdorf's edition published in the fourth volume of his poetae Latini
minores with ample introductions, notes and excursuses. He is not I
think so acute as Leclerc‚ whom I shall henceforth call (1011111113,- but
his learning is great in all that concerns the literature of his subject.
His critical power is I think very small: what chiefly distinguishes his
edition is this, that he was the first to take from Cornelius Severus and
confer on Seneca’s friend Lucilius the authorship of the poem. The
only other edition to be mentioned is Frid. J acob’s published in 1826.
It forms a considerable volume3 and contains a full collation of the
Helmstaedt and Breslau manuscripts. This work, like his Manilirw,
is sadly wanting in 111-60131011 and acumen, and its prolixity exceeds all
bounds of toleration: great weariness of the flesh it often is to read
