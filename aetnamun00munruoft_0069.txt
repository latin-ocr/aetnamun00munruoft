technical involved description: but the clearest accounts are found in
Heron l. 1. and in the curious poem of Publil. Optatianus ap. Wernsdorf
poet. min. Π p. 405 where the arrangement and length of the vss. sug—
gests to the eye the arrangement of the tubes: 41 ‘Perque modos gra-
dibus surget fecunda canoris Aere cauo et tereti, calamis crescentibus
aucta. Quis bene suppositis quadratis ordine plectris Artificis manus in
numeros clauditque aperitque Spiramenta’ will illustrate our V„ and
what follows ‘ Sub quibus unda latens properantibus incita uentis, Quae
uicibus crebris iuuenum labor cet.’‚ looks like 298, where subr. unda
seems a reminiscence of Aen.X227 ‘subremigat undis’: but 1116 ‘arte
regentis Quae tenuem cet.’ must refer to the organist who is playing 011
1116 keys and thus driving the 311· 11110 1116 1111066 60 36 10 produce the
music: it would seem here simply to 1116311 ‘he rows along’, i. e. plays on
the different keys, ‘by means of the water’, which supplies the pressure
by which the air is forced into the tubes 3 for all seem agreed that this
was the sole purpose of the water: Heron p. 229 τὸδὲ ἐν τῷ βωμίσκῳ ὕδωρ
ἐμβάλλεται ἕνεκα τοῦ τᾶν περισσευόντα ἀέρα ἐν τῷ π-ιίγεῖ, λέγω δὴ τὸν ἐκ τῆς
πυξίδος ὠθούμενον ἐπαίροντα τὸ ὕδωρ πρός τὸ cie} ἔχειν τούς αὐλούς δυναμένους
φθέγγεο-θαι : Athen. l. 1. says ἐμπνευστὸν δ’ ἂν ἴσως ῥηθείη διὰ To ἐμπνεῖσθαι
τό ὄργανον ὑπὸ τοῦ ὕδατοςῑ 116 next goes on 1ο describe how this is done.
Pliny however, IX 88, 11666 subremiyo in its liter-al sense of rowing under-
neath: can then the words imply here ‘ he rows below upon the water’,
i. e. while he is playing above with his hands, he is moving something
below with his feet, which sets the water in motion? 299 just in the
same way the wind of Etna muddened at being dislodged by the torrents
of water fights in the sti-aitened rooni, and thus Etna roars mightily like
the bucina of 1116 Triton, or the water-organ, both like it moved by
water. summota furens: see n. 10 67. 301 1101 only are there these
external causes of wind in Etna, but we must believe they are produced
below the earth from causes similar to those outside. 303 premunt
is clearly right, cremant having no meaning here. premunt inter Se is
the proper Latin construction in the sense of ‘mutuo premunt pre-
muntur': Lucr. VI 456 ‘ comprendunt inter sc'3 1 787 ‘inter 66 mutar-(³,
where I give 11161311066 from Cicero, Caesar and Livy. 305 tulaqwe
cet. must mean ‘and do not settle down until they are 111 3 safe place':
bnt perhaps J acob's ‘tuta dum sede’ is necessary: with que in of α ω for
dum, comp. 206 que extra β rightly, dextra, α ω.

306—328: if even you contest what Ι say, you must allow that
rocks tumble underground‚ and so cause a dispersion of air, and produce
wind: also that the moisture of 1111616 produces air and wind 36 we see
on meadows near a river: much greater is the power of water under
the earth⁷ and of winds which by constraint are rendered more violent,
until they burst out with their fires from the crater of Etna. 307
