os erigit’‚ surely a slight change: Strabo pp. 274 275 describes Etna, and
tells how the crater looked to those οἱ νεωστὶ ἀναβάντες, adding, as we
well know, that the form of the crater often changes. In consequence
of the heat they did not get near enough to sce what our poet saw, but
yet ὁρᾶν ἐν τῷ μέσῳ βουνόν τεφρώδη τήν χροάνε when our poet says ‘and
lifts up its head quite beyond', he seems to allude to such a βουνός; the
crater siuks down into the depths 3 then in another direction extends its
liinbs, and beyond lifts up its head: comp. 285 ‘rigido quia uertice
surgit'. Porri'yit and crissie appear to be used with studied point: see n.
to 116. 183 111 another direction riven rocks in huge disorder (disc.
inqens) fill up the space. 184 all these vss. are unintelligible in the
editions: thus they join Inter opus with what precedes, as if it described
the active working of Etna, a sense it elsewhere bears: see n. to 159:
here it means the structure of the crater: aliae rupes internectunt opus.
185 301116 of these rocks already changed in nature by the fire, others
still undergoing the fire. 186 and 195 366111 manifestly spurious,
having no connexion with the context: the latter indeed breaks into the
middle of a sentence: the words themselves are not Latin, at least not
connected Latin. I cannot think it accidental too, that, while in every
other place where Aetna, Aetnaeus occur, α has Ιι after t, in these two,
vss alone it has not. 186 b, found only in β, 13 clearly genuine: such
is the crater of Etna, such the aspect, such the home of its unearthly
working, such the seat and place of such mighty operations.

188—218: so much for the place: now to explain the worker and
cause of eruptions: clouds of sand are thrown up and burning messes:
there is noise enough to frightcn Jupiter for the safety of heaven: but
air and wind are necessary to set all this in effectual movement. 188
corcis] inc. is the ficher of 198, i.e. the spiritus of 217 218: it gives the
eruption its form and power. ccmsamqne i. e. the lnaterials mentioned
below and the fire working on them. 189 190 there is a perplexing
variation 11616 between α and β; the genuineness of the reading given to
the latter I doubt: a’s reading, helped by that of ω, 3661113 to ine right,
though Ι am quite unable to account for that of β, if genuine, except on
the hypothesis of a different recension. 189 comp. Mela 1 70 ‘locus
est magni aliquando discriminis'. 190 sub tempore, though less usual
than sul) tempus, is not uncommon: Lucretius has it VI 413 and 416,
Ovid fasti v 491, and Manilius more than once: the pigsnom of β has a
sense usual in our poeni and may therefore be from conjecture: u. and ω
Ι cannot explain except 011 the supposition that their reading is genuine.
