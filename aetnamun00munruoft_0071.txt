in our and other mss.3 see n. to 81: most editors change it in the
second, where it appears to me in place, while in 324 ‘rupes or a similar
word is required: suo sibi pondere seems to me not to refer to the wind,
but to the rocks, ‘ rolling them over off their equilibrium’: with this use
comp. Lucr. Ἦ 574 ‘recipit prolapsa suas in pondere sedes’, and my note
where I cite among other passages Petron. 136 ‘ anumque pondere suo
deiectam': to the instances there given Ι now add from Stat. Theb. V 374
‘instabili procumbens pondere’3 XII 435 ‘commoto pondere' 3 and ΙΙΙ 37
the plur. ‘ ponderibus': but so too our poet below, 346 ‘ipsa suo decliuia
pondere numquam corpora deripiat’: what just precedes this further
illustrates our passage, ‘spiritus ille Qui rupes terramque rotat cet.' 3
which supports my rupes. With suo sibi referring to rupes and 346
suo comp. such phrases as that just quoted from Petronius, and ‘ suo sibi
gladio hunc iugulo', and Cicero’s ‘desinant insidiari domi suae consuli'3
and with the use of inuolmns, Aen. X11688 ‘siluas armenta uirosque
Inuoluens secum’3 292 ‘ oppositis a tergo inuoluitur aris In caput atque

umeros’: but ‘evoluens' is perhaps to be read. 325· per governs
densa corpora. 326 ‘morantem is any rock that tries to stay the
spiritus. 327 sipla. saccus of α restores the passage: siplco had various

uses 3 but here it denotes a kind of forcing-pump, used as a fire·engine
and for other purposes: among the uigyiles there was a detachment
of siplzonarz’i or firetnen: Pliny epist. 2135 (42), speaking of a fire at
Nicomedia, ‘nullus usquam in publico sipho‚ nulla hama, nullum deni-
que instrumentum ad incendia compescenda’ 3 Isid. orig. XX G 9 ‘siphon
uas appellatum, quod aquas sufflando fundatffubi senserint domum
ardere, currunt cum siphonibus plenis aqua et extinguunt incendia. sed
et camaras expressis ad superiora aquis emundant': Pliny hist. 11166
‘quo spiritu acta et terrae pondere expressa siphonum modo emicat’.
329—35'7: what we see, would be against the hypothesis that the
winds enter by the crater and then are driven out again: thus a still
quiet cloud rests in fine weather high above it, and when an eruption
is not going on, incense is sometimes burned on the very summit: if
however appearances deceive, then it must be from the immense rapidity
with which the winds move, that they elude the senses: this might be

illustrated by various well—known phenomena. 330 Faucibus: Lucr.
vl 701, of Etna, ‘ In summo sunt uertice enim crateres, ut ipsi N omini-
tant: nos quod fauces perhibemus et ora'. 331 locus ipse: the
summit of Etna, or the mouth of the crater. 332 fulyeat of a makes
the passage as clear as the aether itself. 333 Purp. ostro: to Lucr.

11829 Ι cite from Propertius ‘Poenis tibi purpura fulgeat ostris’, and
from Claudian ‘puniceo ostro& iubar aureus: Priscian quotes from
Ennius ‘albus iubar' 3 and in another grammarian we find ‘splendidus
iubar': Lucr. IV 404 uses iubar of the rising sun: ‘rubrum tremulis
