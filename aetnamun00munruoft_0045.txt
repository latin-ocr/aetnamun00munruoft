any positive evidence in favour of his being the author of our poem, the
various points I have discussed would to my mind rather increase than
diminish the probability. But there is no such evidence3 and though
Lucilius might seem to have a somewhat better claim than any other
single name, yet, as between him and the whole Roman world, the
chances must be great against him. ‘ Aetna’ therefore still remains and
I fancy ever will remain the work ‘incerti auctoris'.

Our poem is on the whole singularly unattractive and of meagre
merit enough: the poet seems to have been urged to his task not by the
muse, but by a most conscientious desire to enlighten an ignorant world
011 the true causes of the eruptions of Etna and the real nature of the
much misunderstood lava-stone. More than half the poem is taken up
with describing at most vexatious length first the many ways in which
wind and air help to rouse the subterranean sires, and then the manner
in which the ‘lapis molaris’ is really fused. The first 90 verses are
formal and have a strong twang of the school 3 the concluding episode of
the Cat-anian brothers is stiff and constrained, and quite fails of the
pathos it is intended to produce. Perhaps the best lines in the poem,
as Jacob 1136 remarked, are 224-269, which touch on a theme suited
to the Roman tone of thought3 and, for similar reasons, 568—598. As
Ι have already said, our Cambridge manuscript is my sole inducement
to publish this edition: it seemed to me, considering the good age of the
poem, worth while 130 give it to the world, in an improved shape. Its
attractions are too small to make me care to keep it longer by me and
try to correct more completely its exceedingly corrupt text. I give it
therefore to the world well aware how much has yet to be done3 how
much, that appears to me satisfactory, will be found defective by intelli-
gent readers. -As another edition of such a poem is not likely 10 be
called for, if on subsequent reflexion anything new might occur or
should critics publicly or privately suggest to me corrections, Ι might
by and bye add these in the form of au appendix to the present work.

One more point I have here to touch upon. As soon as I had be-
gun to revise the poem, I looked about for what might help my pur-
pose. Ascertaining that Professor M. Haupt had written two programs
on the poem, I sought of course at once to obtain them. By 311 1111-
lucky accident they were neither in my own library nor 111 any library
public or private, so far as I could 163111, 111 Cambridge, Oxford or Lon-
don. My booksellers after some delay obtained for me the second one
of 1859, from which I have got one brilliant emendation: the earlier
one of 1854 was reported from Berlin and other places as wholly out of
print. It has only just been procured for me after long advertising.
Its importance I at once recognised; but 36 Ι was not inclined to re-
model my work, a part of which was already in the printer's hands, I
