credaszcredit aliquis: this use of the 2nd pers. sing. potential is ex-
tremely frequent in Latin: comp. Madvig gram. 370, and my n. to
Lucr. 1 327 possiszpossumus or potest aliquis, and 11 41 Cum uideas:
uidemus 01· uidet aliquis: Madvig observes that this idiom is of very ex-
tensive use, employed alike in the chief clauses of sentences, or, as
here, after conjuncti011S, si, cum, etc„ or relatives: the imperf. is so used
as well as the present: Lucr. v1332 and VI 1268 uideres 3 and posses
more than once: with this union of esc and credas comp. Lucr. 11 850
‘ Quoad licet ac possis’‚ where Lachmann's potis es is no more necessary
than Jacob's credis here: the same idiom occurs below, 401 ‘si sorte
manu teneas ae...ccl-nas,...putes’, where Jacob quite spoils the passage
by violent and useless changes: teneas and cernas do not ‹lepend on si
forte, but: tenemus, cernimus, 309 Promere seems quite necessary:
the caverns tumble in3 and the air thus displaced rushes about and
raises wind: Lucr. VI 545 ‘Subter ubi ingentis speluncas subruit aetas:
Quippe cadunt toti montes': this use of proruere appears in the silver
age: Tac. ann. xv 22 ‘motu terrae...oppidum Pompei magna ex parte
proruit’. 310 crescere of o. allays at once ‘certamina tanta’ of editors⁷
Scaliger, Gorallus‚ Wemsdorf, Jacob. 311 qffzmclere, animas or auras:
it is curious how he has dwelt and continues to dwell on this production ⁴
of air and wind from moisture. But in ahot climate the difference in
temperature between the air ancl running waters often makes the
currents of air very perceptible. 314 Flam. parua seem to be the
riui taken from the amnis and distributcd for irrigation over the fields:
Pliny ΙΙΙ 119 ‘[Padus] deductus in flumina et fossas inter Rauennam
Altinumque’: Flamina appears to come from a misunderstanding of the
passage. ocis i. e. harum aurarum, ‘currents of air from water’.

315 ‘humor adspirat fortes auras, et uerberibus impellit'‚ thus increasing
their force: Aen. v (507 ‘uentosque adspirat eunti': but our passage is

very obscurely expressed, if the mss. are right. 316 in uacuo, ‘in the
open air'. rorum is a fine correction of J acob's: Lucretius uses it several
times for water or moisture generally: see my note to 1 496. 317
clusi: this form, to judge from the best mss„ of Juvenal for instance
and Seneca, was common in the silvei· age. 318 panibus, ‘ within the

carth‚’ is opposed to eastra: the word often occurs with this sense 111 0111·
poem: causac is nomin. to Exayitant: the same causes act 011 the winds
beloxv3 and being there pent up, these work with more fury: the notion
he again and again so ela-borately insists on. 320 suffocat, the passage
chokes the winds as they are thus fighting, and compels them to burst
out. 323 (mlstr. cert. is much the same as Puynantz's suffocat. tomy-
iem is illustrated by ‘primos ultimus urgct’: one spiritus strikes on
another, and so impcls it onwards‚ as one ware another wave. 324
325 uires of one v. has como from uires of the other: a common error
