rocks and vaulted caverns of Etna! 344 Qui rupes: 566 11. 10 324

345 Cam rexit cet. I take as aorists of repeated action: when above all
(supposing this theory to be true of the winds going down the crater and
then ‘isdem pulsos remeare ’) this air is in that case used to guide

its powers and abruptly change its course. 346 15 illustrated by

their equilibrium or fixed position. 34¹7 παῖ. abs. arcu: and loose

them from their strong-arched vault, i. e. tear down the ccmernae:

348 si of ᾳ ὃ seems 10 me right: ozi or nisi of inferior mss. and all
editions appears to ruin the sense: in his uncertainty he is now
assuming the truth of 329 ‘isdem decurrere uentos cet.': if Ι am wrong,
at all events appearances are on my side, and the great calm at the top
of Etna can only be explained by the fact that these winds move with
such rapidity, the eye cannot 566 their effects, as when persons are
