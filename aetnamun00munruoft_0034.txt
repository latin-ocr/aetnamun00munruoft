did not understand it, until I had written down at length in what way
I proposed to explain it. This Ι hope will be found to be not the least
useful portion of this small work.

Our poem is found in some only of the earlier editions of Virgi13
and these appear to have all essentially the same text, having been
printed no doubt one from the other. I have before 1110 two editions of
1475, Rubeus' dated J anuary of that year and Ienson's, both belonging
to our Trinity library: their texts are throughout the sanie in all but
quite unimportant points, except that Ienson in :314 has, probably from
conjecture, the correct manuscript reading Ζθηίο, while Rubeus and
I believe all other early editions have uento. These then Ι have deemed
amply sufficient to represent the whole class, since, as might be expected
in so corrupt a poem, they follow the text of a late and very interpolated
manuscript. Our poem first appears in a greatly corrected form in the
Aldine edition of the catalecta and other minor poenis dated December
1517. This and the second Aldine of March 1534 Ι have had before 1116,
and have found them both most useful in determining the history of our
text: the second is mostly a repriut of the first, but yet has a good
many important variations from it and in not a few cases is the first so
far as I know to offer a correct text. Once I have found the right
reading first in Gryphius’ edition of 1547. But soon all other editions
were to be superseled by Scaliger’s Virgilii Appendix, printed at Lyons
in 1572 and published in that or the following year: of two copies
before me one, Duport’s‚ from our Trinity libi-ary has on the title-page
15723 the other 1573, which appears to be the usual date. A second
edition was published at Leyden in 1595, with some changes and
additional remarks by Scaliger and the editor Lindenbruch. Anything
coming from Scaliger must display learning, power and originality3 and
I do not think that any work of his on the Latin poets has these
qualities in a higher degree than his notes on the Aetna. Its great
difficulty put him on his mettlc3 its poetry too had for hin] a singular
attraction: following the older Italian authorities, not the more cautious
Aldine editor, he attributed it to Ovid’s friend Cornelius Severus and
therefore to the age of Augustus or Tiberius: ‘quo neque post tempora
Tiberii Caesaris cultius poema neque mendosius ullum ad nos peruenit’,
he says at the end of his notes. The latter clause is true enough ,- 1116
former he will find few to approve. As is often seen in vigorous haters‚
his antipathy to Lucan made him eontrast our poet savourably with
‘isti pingues Cordubenses poetae, Musarum e’xrpuifram'. He set himself
1116101016 earnestly at work to correct and explain our poem. Having
besides the printed editions only one late and interpolated manuscript,
he must often from the nature of the case go wide astray. Yet in not
a few instances with the glauce of genius he descries the truth through
