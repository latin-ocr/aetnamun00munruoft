plainly right: the strange unmeaning Panope of β is a gross and pal-
pable interpolation, whether old or new, evidently coming from one who
did not understand what was said: ‘why, when Phoebe’s fire is ruddy,
her brother-’s pale, this portends clouds for heaven, rains for earth’:
Virgil geor. 1431 says ‘uento semper rubet aurea Phoebe’5 and wind
and rain have very similar prognostics: perhaps ibid. 441 442, which

cont-ain the signs of rain, imply paleness of the sun. 238 β is alone
right. uer cet.: Cic. Cato 70 ‘uer enim tamquam adolescentiam signi-

dog of Icarius or Icarus he brought Erigone to her father's dead body:
the story is told fully by Servius geor. 11389: editors seem all to miss
strangely the meaning: Ovid several times terms him ‘ Icarius canis'.

content to think of them as a mere confused mass: conqesta of β must
be right.
