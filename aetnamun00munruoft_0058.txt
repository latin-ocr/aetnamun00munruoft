our poet follows a stoic: but 111 Manil. 163 we should surely read ‘Et
saccata magis struxerunt aequora terram’: the sea in clearing itself
strained off its slime and so helped to build up the dry land: siccata, of
mss. and'editions has no sense: the best mss. have strumarum, not
strinoeermzt of editions. 105 tortis in α alone: neither NVernsdorf nor
Jacob adopting it, though Davies de nat. deor. p. 201 says ‘tortis rim.
ca. quemadmodum diserte representat ms. qui fuit iu bibliotheca prae-
stantissima Ioannis Mori, nuper Eliensis episcopi’ i. e. our α. These vss.
are unintelligible in all mss. but α, and editions have made matters
worse. 106 Exilia: Manil. Ι 165 ‘orbisque per undas Exiliit'3 Lu-
cilius 111111οΓ ap. Seu. nat. quaest. 111 1 1 ‘Elisus Siculis de fontibus
exilit amnis’. 107 the end of this v. too is only in a: in other mss.
it is wanting, or as in all editions absurdly corrupted. charybdis is
curicus: it may be added to the Greek words he uses in a Greek sense:
comp. Eur. suppl. 501 Οὐδ’ ἥρπασεν χάρυβδις οἰωνοσκόπον Τέθριππον ἅρμα
περιβαλοῦσα χάσματιι Strabo p. 275 Ὀρόντης ἐν τῇ Συρίᾳ καταδὺς εἰς τὸ
μεταξὺ χάσμα Ἀπαμείας καὶ Ἀντιοχείας, ὃ καλοῦσι χάρυβδιν κ.τ.λ.

110 foll. or if it was not so formed at its birth, Nec nata cet.‚ but
was hollowed out by Subsequent, though ancient causes, by air within try-
ing to escape or the water eating out a way. causa uetusta is either·
the liber spiritus or the lympha peremis. 111 liber cet. : the air within
roving freely about, wherever it has space, in trying to escape gradually
forces a way for itself. intra has the same adjectival force that retro in
140 has, and extra in 457. 113 Edit is perf. of edo: for the position
of que see n. to 79: Scaliger-’s lima for limo, adopted by many, seems
very unsuitable to mollit. 114 a 3rd possible cause: my findere for
uidere, ‘have sused', is surely better than uicere. 116 docendi...
ccmsas seems to me nearer the mss. and to give a better sense than
(locemla...eausa‚ as opus causae appears scarcely Latin: there is a kind
of studied point in causa—causas, ‘ there is 110 cause (i. e. need or occa-
sion) for explaining the causes, so long as we have the effect': this kind
of point is common in our poet and in his age generally: comp. 122
‘ trahat—- contrahat’: and with causa docendi comp. Cic. de diu. 11 6 ‘ac
mihi quidem explicandae philosophiae causam adtulit casus grauis ciui-
tatis’. 117 the end of this v. too is perfect only 111 a: Aldus
comes near to a: γὸ ε omit the words altogether. 119 here too a v. is
surely lost, such as ‘ Rursus saepe solet uastaque uoragine condi’: comp,
132 ‘praecipiti conduntur flumina terra': the sudden appearance or
disappearance of rivers, even large ones, is more common in lands known
to the poet than in ours: comp. Strabo quoted to 107 5 Sen. nat. quaest.
111 263 ‘quaedam fiumina palam 111 aliquem specum decidunt et sic ex
oculis auferuntur’: and comp. what follows with what follows in our
poem. 120-122 are very corrupt in all but a: my alterations
