of a copy of Pithoeus⁷ edition, Paris 1590. On the back of the title-
page was written ‘In Aetna V. significat cod. Florentinum, quem inde
habuit Ernstius, nempe solum partem illam’. Matthiae thinks the
collation is not Ernstius', but N. Heinsius', as Burmann, n. to Ovid
met. 1 85, gives two of its readings with these words ‘sed legendum ex
antiquo codice Mediceo quem Heinsius contulit‘. One Henr. Ernstius
published in 1641 a very brief catalogue of the Laurentian library: in it
I find no mention of this codex: he enumerates merely the same msS. of
Virgil which Bandini describes: Lucca would seem to be the place
where it really existed. I have taken great pains to get from these two
sources as complete a collation as Ι could of this fragment of 150 lines:
it begins with V. 138 and ends with 286: but we have no account what-
ever of its condition, its age, its orthography3 for the one or two notable
⁴instances, as caussa, erranteis, which the· collations record, I feel con-
vinced come merely from the edition of Pithoeus, which so prints these
words: not one remarkable spelling I believe is given differing from
Pithoeus. WVernsdorf suspects its best readings and scarcely makes any
use of them: Jacob employs them often very unskilfully. Yet for this
part of the poem which chauces to be obscure, this fragment is quite
invaluable: many passages are not intelligible without it. To doubt
its essentia] genuineness is monstrous: in 150 vss. it gives ten times as
many brilliant and certain corrections of the other mss. as a Scaliger can
make in the whole poem. Quite as incontestable in my opinion is its
superiority over α 111 these vss. as is the superiority of ο, over all other
mss. : when one finds so much here that can be understood only from β,
0110 trembles to think how much must remain uncorrected in the rest of
the poem. β gives 113 two lines, found in no other ms. : as α 111 the other
parts gives us 3 or 4 other vss. which ω, i. e. all the other mss. want, Ι
infer that to suppose a lacuna of one or more vss. in some other difficult
passages is a legitimate and simple method of emendation. One certain
test, if test be wanted, of the genuineness of β 13 this: in some of the
passages in which it is right α alone agrees with it, ω are all different:
in still more it is right or nearly so, then follows α, then come ω, 11111011
farther than α. from β; for examples of the first kind look at 230 11111010,
188 incendi, 163 sese: for instances of the second kind see 151, 157,
162, 165, 166, 169 170, 214, and 210 and 212, both not-able instances:
as samples of the excellence of β compared with all others, comp. 138,
140‚141,153‚158‚ 159, 160, 161, 166, 175, 182, 183, 184, 187,192,
194, 199, 206, 209, 214, 216, 220, 221, 224, 227, 233, 238, 246, 248,
253, 264, 279, 284, 286; again β alone has 276 277 278 111 their right
places. But then 011 the other hand α has points of superiority over β,
ω too agreeing more with α than with β, as might be expected: thus in
the 3 verses last referred to and in 259 which follows them, though β
