Pliny. , 430 Ι follow a: extincta depends on Dicitur. super, i.e. et

what precedes, and Petronius 120, V. 67 ‘Est locus exciso penitus de-
mersus hiatu Parthenopen inter magnaeque Dicarchidos arua, cet.'
Petronius was probably contemporary with our author. 432 ut ubere,
to express its great plenty: see the last words quoted from Strabo.

433 fecundius seems to agree with ubere, rather than sulphur. 434

‘Gabinio Secundo...cognomen Cauchius usurpare concessit': Rotunda
is the Greek Στρογγύληε it and Hiera next mentioned are both described
as active volcanoes by Diodorus v 7.

435 and 436 are bct-h given rightly by 0. alone. 436 Et lapis: a
stone too helps‚ well suited for kindling fires, but yet without the proper-
ties of the true molaris of Etna: Diod. l. l. ἐκφυσᾶται δὲ καὶ ἄμμος καὶ
λίθων διαπύρων πλῆθος. 439 Insula, the fourth of these places: it is
called Ἱερσῖ Ἡφαίστου by both Diodorus and Strabo. durat adhuc of
Scaliger, adopted by later editors, has no meaning, as he and the rest
understand the sentence: they take incendi of 440 to be a genitive
and join it with what follows: ‘the greater part of the conflagration
has cooled down': what follows proves that Pars is pars insulae, as
otherwise 440 and 441 have no sense: incendi is the infin.: ‘the
island, but a part of it only, still continues to burn: the greater
portion etc.': duro could take an infin. 111 our author’s age: Petron. 41

of adhuc might easily bc absorbed in the foll. word 5 but perhaps adhuc
durat was what the poet wrote. 445 ο. alone preserves the end of
this V.: the fact of a connexion between the Lipari islands and Etna
seems to be still a moot point: see Daubeny p. 264. 446 siluamque:
comp. 385 and n. there. 447 pasceret is clearly needed.

448—509: but you may see for yourself that this lava is the chief
agent in eruptions: look at its effect all round the mountain: it involves
all other materials in its own fierce conflagmtion, it is dangerous for
any to approach the scene of action 3 some of the stones will burn away
to a cinder, but the great stream of lava advances, miles in breadth,
