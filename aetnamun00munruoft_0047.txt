domitast, stantis: domita stanti a: ω omit the verse: 548 inqeniost:
ingenio est ζ ς’, ingenium est α. ω ; 607 Zonyumst : longum α. ω z 388 ter-
mest: terrent α. ωε teo-mest first became terres-t : 631 raperes& : rapies α. ω t
410 fides-t 3 ut tum est : fides tutum est ω, fide tutum est α. ; on the other
hand, 256 seques ο, ω rightly, segne est βε 448 notis α rightly: nota est ζς,
nocte γ δ ε. This st is a very fruitful source of corruption: I believe
for instance that in Propert. 111 (11) 34 53 we should read ‘Nec si post
Stygias aliquid rest (i. e. re est) arbiter undas': comp. ‘Sunt aliquid
manes’ and the like. Probably 111 many cases where our mss. now give
est in full, our author wrote st, as in 19 instances in which est now
occurs at the end of a verse 3 as well as in no less than 38 instances
where a vowel or an m is elided before est by our mss. in other parts of
the verse. If the poet did not always write the enclitic st, he probably
meant us so to prononnce, as in most of these cases an elision would not be
admissible according to his principles of versification which are mostly
Ovidi-an, the prevailing fashion in his age. Thus while que or other
instances of ἔ are freely ended, more than 100 times; he is much more
chary in eliding εἰ or a syllable ending in m, and in the whole poem
there are hardly more than 20 cases of the elision of a long vowel 3 and.
in these last as well as thosc of ἄ and m a very large proportion os the
elisions occur between the first and 2nd foot or in the middle of the 4th,
where to our taste and that of the ancients such elisions sounded less
harsh than elsewhere. In other cases the elision was designed to pro-
duce some particular effect. qratior: Mart. 1v 44 5 ‘Haec Veneris sedes
Lacedaemone gratior illi'.

Hyla is the same thing as the ila of α, the aspirate then and long
before being nothing and y and i being interchangeable : thus 49 olim-
pus, 507 Simetlci, and on the other hand 119 hyatu, 602 syrius for
Sirius : on the one hand ospitium, eaeazcstos with le, written above, ac for
haec, on the other cohercet, chola-laide, Ιιασ for ac : see Ribbeck's proleg. to
Virgil p. 422 423, 427, 452 and the authorities he cites: α. writes
throughout aalma and aethnaeus. For Hyla compare Stephanus Byz.
S. V. ι7Υλη, πόλις Κύπρου ἐν ἧ Ἀπόλλων τιμᾶται ’Υλοὶτης Λυκόφρων [448]
καὶ Σάτραχον βλώξαντες Ὑλοῖτου τε γῆν; where the scholiast says Ὕλοὶ-
του· τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος· ’Υλη γὰρ ἐστὶ περὶ τόν Κούριον, τόπον τῆς Κύπρου,
ἱερὰ Ἀπόλλωνος, ἀφ’ ἧς ’Υλσῖτην τόν θεὸν προσαγορεύουσιν; Eustath. Il.
E 708 ἦν δέ φασι καὶ Λοκρικὴ πόλις κνΥλη, καὶ ἄλλη Κύπρου ἐφ’ ἧς καὶ
Ὕλοῖτης Ἀπόλλων παρὰ Λυκόφρονι. These passages Ι quote at length,
because they are the only ones I know where this ’Ύλη is mentioned by
name3 though Strabo p. 683 alludes to the same worship: εἶτα πόλις
Κούριον ὅρμον ἔχουσα, Ἀργείων κτίσμα, ἤδη οὖν ποίρεστι σκοπεῖν τήν
ρᾳθυμίαν τοῦ ποιήσαντος τό ἐλεγεῖον τοῦτο οὗ ἦ ἀρχὴ Ἱραὶ τῷ Φοίβῳ
πολλόν διδ. κῦμα θέουσαι ”Ηλθομεν αἱ ταχιναὶ τόξα φυγεῖν ἔλαφοι. εἶθ”
