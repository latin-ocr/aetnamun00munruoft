has them in the right order, α has clearly the better readings. This is
thc case too in other passages, for which I refer to the critical notes and
commentary: thus in 230 the strange Panope of β 18 difficult to account
for except on the hypothesis of designed interpolation: in other cases
such as 244 I cannot decide between ‘ tendant' of αω, and ‘pandant’ of
β; 203 ‘magnos' of αω, and ‘tantos' of β; 111 111081 of these instances I
prefer the readings of α and ω, because I am sure of their genuineness 3
while we cannot say in the absence of all evidence whether the readings
of β may not have been tampered with. In several passa-ges for reasons
given in the commentary I prefer σ. decidedly to βε in a feW‚ such as
189 190, and 251, if we have the genuine lections of β, Ι can only ac-
count for them by supposing two recensions in ancient times But β 18
100 short a fragment and the evidence for each different reading too
uncertain 10 enable us 10 decide such a question, or to determine what
is the exact relation between ssand am: advice and correction on this
part of my subject Ι would gladly receive. β contained vss. 138—286,
or 149 vss. of a, but it had two, 186 b and 235 b, wanting in α and ω.
Α1 1110 same time it is not likely that it had both 186 and 195 of α, 1110
21111 of which at all events is incontestably spurious. Probably therefore
the fragment contained exactly 150 lines, and filled three leaves of 25
lines to the page, which had got detached from the rest. It is likely “
then that the first 137 vss. of the poem filled also three leaves 3 and
since they would not give its full complement of 25 lines to each page,
this might be employed as a further argument that several vss. have
been lost in α. and w: an assumption peremptorily called for by other
and more cogent reasons.

A few words have now to be said of the reputed authors of our
poem. It came down among the smaller works attributed to Virgi13
10 whom it is assigned by our best mss. α γ ει δ has simply ‘de etna
monte.’ As it has manifestly no claim whatever, less even than tho
culex or ciris 10 110 1118 welk, I need not controvert what none will
now maintain. The name of Cornelius Severus has found more ac-
ccptanee 111 modern times: to him it was given by some Italian scholar
at least as carly as the 15111 century5 for my ζ bears his name 011

with the heading CORNELI SEVERI AETNA. The early editions have
Virgil’s name together with the words ‘a quibusdam Cornelio tribuitur⁷;
and, though the more cautious Aldine editor calls it ‘incerti authoris',
Scaliger in his passionate exaggeration of the mei-its of the poem gladly
gave its authorship to a poet of so good an age as Cornelius Severus.
