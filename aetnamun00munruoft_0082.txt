Terence: it often denotes actual agency 3 but often too as here, merely
means ‘I will warram, engage, wager’5 as Plaut. curc. 586 ‘in tri-
tico facillime Vel quingentos curculiones pro uno faxo reperies' 3 Men.
468 ‘Non esse 611111 dices faxo: ita ignorabitur'; pseud. 49 ‘Recita
modo: ex tabellis iam faxo scies': or fizaeim, as aulul. 490 ‘Ego faxim
muli, pretio qui superant equos, Sint uiliores Galliae cantheriis’ ε faxo
continued to be used by the poetS, virgil, Ovid, Val. Flaccus, Silius,
Statius, generally with the sense of agency, but not alwayS‚ asin Stat.
Theb. VIII 78 ‘ F axo haud sit cunctis leuior motus atra mouere Tartara,
frondenti quam iungere Pelion Ossae'. 509 perles is clearly to be
read: the pe was absorbcd 111 persaepe and then cles became (lies which
has no sense at all: the lava has often been observed to lie deeper even
than this.

510—535: do not be misled by false analogies to think that the
lapis molaris is not one uniform substance: it is as much so as copper,
which you know to be copper after it is fused as well as before: other
stones may burn 3 yet they never fuse like the molaria—One is tempted
to think the main purpose of his poem was to enlighten the world on
the true nature of the lapis molaris, which sciolists had grossly misre-
presented. I have hardly changed a letter of α. here: later mss. and all ⁴
editions have rendered the passage unintelligible; obscure it is at the
best. 512 the flucre of α alone gives light here: in vain he tries, he
says, to explain his subject, if you believe the fable that it is a different
substance that is fused by the fire: then the simillae cet. is not very
clear3 but he seems to say that these people hold that the Flumina, or
lava-stream, then harden by having the property of fauilla: Flumina
has reference to fluere; comp. too 497 Flumina consistunt ripis: this
passage in later mss. and consequently in all editions has no meaning.
513 proprietate: comp. Pliny XIII 121 ‘proprietatmu habet fructum
amittendi lanugine'3 Sen. epist. 84 4 ‘an quae collegerunt, in hunc
saporem mixtura quadam et proprietate spiritus sui mutent': ib. 118
13-17 the word occurs six times. siue i. e. 1161 si: or if they falsely
think that it is sulphur mixed with bitumen that burns in the molaris:
above he has shewn that these substances and alumen do burn in other
volcanoes 3 but the molaris is independent of them and indeed far more
powerful. 515 these people attempt to shew this by such a fact as
the following: after potter's clay they say is burned in the furnace its
substance is fused; and the potters give proof of this fact3 and then by
cold it again hardens. 516 figuli sunt fides huic: comp. 504 ‘ plagis

—fides’ ‚- and 177. 518 but such a mark common to different things
is too slight to build upon. 519 trepidat ‘wavers and is uncertain':
opposed to cerco uerum cet. 520 the poet's own proof : the molaris is

of a uniform nature like coppor which is the same after as before fusion.
