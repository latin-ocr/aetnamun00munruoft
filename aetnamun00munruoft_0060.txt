bunt et, 611111 11661111, 111 faucibus’: Va].F1a‹:c. 1 333 ‘haesuraque uerba
relinque Auribus’, the sense is different. 138 11616 we have to begin
to mediate between β and αω. densae noeti of αω Ι prefer to densa
‘nocte of β, as less trite: we might compare Virgil's lateri condidit en-
sem. 140 141 are intelligible in β 310116. cubilia are the holos used

reading assigned to the latter is not genuine 3 as operum seems necessary :

give the required sense: ‘tantum effluit intra [Flatibus assiduis aer:

unknown depths of earth. Pliny, Seneca and others often mention wind
coming out of hollows and caves in the earthj the great difference of
temperatum in 1101 6001111163 between 1116 011161 air and that within,
making 11113 probably very perceptible. Perhaps the lacuna is greater
than 0116 V. 144 cuo-(cs hardly gives any sense: causas, as Jacob says,
is what we want. 145 abstrahe cet. must mean ‘draw from things

next V., and changing the stopping, the sentence is plain: ct quo plura

158—187: these winds, and the fires and other disturbances which
they occasion, have not their origin near the surface: they come from
below and are the effects of great pressure and resistance. Look at
Etna and the wild confusion within its crater: 11113 will give you the
clearest conception of tremendous movements. 158 foll. are 11116111.-

neous disturbances generally, whether resulting in earthquakes or vol-
canoes 01 1116 like: the hiatus, probably of more than one v.‚ after 142
renders the whole passage obscure. 158 summis causis must mean
‘ causes arising 011 1116 surface': perhaps we might compare Aen. XII 434
‘ Summaque per galeam delibans oscula’. 159 opus here and 169 means
the work or result produced by these commotions3 and then in 186 b,
195, 33⁴5, 565 the like work or result in reference to Etna specially.
