incline to ‘Haud similis terere hos cursus'. hos i.e. uentos of 372 foll.

and 378. 378 uentis: the ms. reading 6011163 from end of 377: see n.
to 81. 379 (611 1116 swifter owing to the hindrance’: comp. n. to 280
impediat. 384 strange that no editor could restore this reading of α,

63 116 had merely to divide differently the words of ω. 385 superant,
either ‘come to 1116 1οΡ’ 01· ‘abound'. rigant ina: metaph. from
spreading the riui over a field: comp. Lucr. 11 262 ‘motus per membra
rigantur’, and my 11. there. siluae ‘materials’‚ 6 translation of 1116
Greek ὕλης 446 116 joins ‘Materiam siluamque suani’: the plur. seems
curious. 386 uocant=uacantt comp. 120 nocuoque and n. there:
uocant and nutriet seem to me both necessary: a and e are among the
letters often inter-changed in our mss. 3 as 398 liquent for liquant.
quod i. e. quoad: comp. Lucr. 11 248 ‘quod cernere possis' and my n.
there: my changes of the text in this and the preceding v. are slight,
and I think give a better sense 111611χ 111036 of other editors. 387 uer-
nac. mat. are the sulphur, alumen, and bitumen mentioned presently.
illis causis depends on utile: ‘a kind of earth serving, when in contact
with fire, as 6 means for producing those effects'. Daubeny in his
work on volcanoes treats in p. 280 briefly of 1116 materials of Etna,
and p. 288 of the lavas: there is a most elaborate work by Sartorius
von Waltershausen on the volcanic stones in Sicily and Iceland. But
I am not competent 10 decide how far our author illustrates or is
illustrated by modern researches. 389 Daubeny p. 280, speaking
of the vapours from the crater in 1832, says ‘these appear 10 have
been sulphureous‚ 63 was the 6636 when I visited the crater in 1824'.

390 Jacob‘s certain correction alumine is confirmed by Vitruvius and
Dolomieu‚ both of whom he quotes: Pliny xxxv 183 foll. gives an account
of the various kinds of alumen. 392 corporis = materiae. 393 the
sentence seems quite sound, but I can bring no exact parallel to the
words which mean, ‘and to shew that this substance runs through
the whole mountain'. 395 robore: 6 very favourite word of our
author to express the substance, the kern, what gives the stones he
speaks of or other substances their distinguishing properties: so 401,
405, 412, 423, 503, 515, 521, 536. 396 suco: comp. 390. 397 alu-
mine here too, as in 390, 3661113 clearly the right reading. 398 liquant
is active, incendia being its subject. 399 116 now for 160 vss. gives
a most minute account of the lava of Etna, the lapis molaris as he and
others call it: Pliny XXXVI 137 ‘ molarem quidam pyriten uocant,
quoniam plurimus sit ignis illi': Daubeny p. 288 gives a short account
of the lavas of Etna: silem was the most general term for all volcanic
basalts. 401 teneas, cernas, quaeras are not subjunctives governed
of si forte, but optatives with that force explained in n. to 307: coms.
too 550 ‘si uelis’, and Lucr. 11 1090 ‘si teneas': so that Jacob’s altera-
