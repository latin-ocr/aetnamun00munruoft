substances:'the great lava-stream goes on, leaving behind *it what it
cannot carry with it. 495 496 the rhythm of these two vss. is very
unusual in a poet of this age, and seems intended for an echo of the
sense, being a reminiscence of an older poet, Lucretius or rather catal-
lus: 493-496 taken with 483—485 at once recalled to my mind Catul.
LXIV 269 ‘qualis flatu placidum mare matutino Horrificans zephyrus
procliuas incitat undas...Quae tarde primum clementi flamine pulsae
Procedunt...Post uento crescente magis magis increbrescunt’ : but our
author was probably unoonscious of this. 49¹7 Flumina are of course
the streams oslava. 500 when a mass of lava has cooled, it smokes and
is carried 011 for a time by its own momentum: comp. 26 27. 501 sonanti

impact on the solid ground. 504 Em. em: comp. 468 ‘atra sonant

play& cet.: this passage has been much mutilated in late mss, and all
editions : I keep to α. without changing a letter: the constr. is ‘ saxa, scin-
tillas procul esse fides est plagis’ z ‘ the fact that burning stenes, that sparks
are far away, far away as they fall to the ground, is a proof that thjs is
caused by blows’: for this sense of fides comp. 516 ‘ Et figulos huic esse
fidem' i. e. in the oratio recta ‘Et figuli huic sunt fides’: ‘potters give proof
of this'3 and 177 ‘Aetna sui manifesta fides’, and n. there. 505 uemcm,
cet. ‘but when its force has carried the stream of fire over the banks of
SymaethuS, scarce any one, I warrant, will sever them from the fiery
mass that has joined them': here I have adhered strictly to α, only spel-
ling Symczetlci right and reading saxo forfiaeo: later mss. (though their
corruptions may be understood from α.) and all editions have played
strange tricks with 507 : this is what the last editor Jacob has brought
himself to print: ‘Si uoltum anthmcinum, quum et ripas traxerit
amnis’. The Symaethus, one of the largest, I believe the largest river
of Sicily, flows along the western and southern base of Etna and falls
into the sea a little south of Catania: there is abundant evidence of the
lava reaching it: Sartorius v. NValtershausen speaks of the bed of the
Simeto being strewed with blocks of lava: the curious preciseness with
which our author speaks of the banks being covered is thus to be
explained: he was evidently an eye-witness 3 and it is a well—known fact
that when the lava—stream is brought into cont-act with water, a fearful
eruption and dispersion take place ς so that the banks would be covered
with a continuous mass of lava, while the river would only have dis-loa
cated blocks init: with the words dimoverit and obruta moles of 509
