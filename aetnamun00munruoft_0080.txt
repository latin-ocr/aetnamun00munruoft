humor of 481. 485 pronis I read for prunis of ατ primis collibus
seems to have no sense, Wernsdorf says ⁴ summo de monte', which the
words could not mean: he shews too that he fancied the great lava
torrents came out of the crater at the top, a rare occurrence in Etna,
scientific observers remarking that it proves the great strength of the
crust of Etna that lava seldom bursts through at a lower elevation
than 2000 feet or so: Daubeny p. 272 says that the grandest feature
of Etna is the zone of subordinate volcanie 111115 with which it is 611-
coinpassed of which 80 are enumerated: this would seem to explain the
‘pronis collibus’, and render unnecessary Scaliger-'s callibus, an elegant
and, as a and ο are so often interchanged in our mss, easy correc-
tion. 486 many streams issuing from different colles would join 111
forming one great stream: even longer distances than 16 1111165 have
been noted. 487 curuis seems to give the sense required: the lava
would always more or less present such a shape from its meeting with
different obstacles in different parts: comp. 494 curvo, 495 simas3 and
Murray's hand-book for Sicily p. 419, speaking of Catania and the erup-
tion of 1669, ‘the wall was not here overthrown...it stood erect with the
lava curling over the top like a rocky billow, as is still visible'. 488
cenet, ‘attempts to stop'. puyncmc: his favourite metaphor: things⁴
carried along by the stream clash and fight with each other and with it:
Scaliger’s pmycmt is very enticing. 489 haec tela, the curvi iynes or
lava—stream: battle is ever in his thoughts. 490 ficciles, which
readily conform to its shape. 491 liquor of 483 is still the sub-
ject. 492 perpascitur z depascitur, or perpopulatur: a sense I do not
find elsewhere 3 but perpasco in Varro z depasco. 493 increpat seems
to mean ‘it dashes with a lond 110150 its waves 111 motion upon its
watcrs which are standing’ i. e. which have stuck in othe hollows of
491. 495 its undae are first tenetes, then, as they go on, become inore
and more simae, cui-ling, or turned up: I scarcely in all these vss. alter
a letter of a: former editions make the wildest changes: simus perhaps
is hardly used elsewhere in Latin with the force it has here 3 but in
Greek the word has many cognate applications With this and what
precedes compare Daubeny p. 285, speaking of 1819, ‘two other aperturos
took place a little underneath, from the lowest of which a stream of lava
procccded. This was augmented by strcains from the other four craters,
which, nniting into one body of lnolten matter, poured themselves into
the Val di Bove. There, according to ΜΓ Sempe, its surface presented
that ruggcd and irregular aspect which belongs to lava-streams flowing
down a considerable slope, and advancing consequently at a compara-
tivcly rapid rate’: this passage will illustrate too the ‘ pronis collibus'.
496 thore is clearly a lacuna here and probably of more than one v. :
