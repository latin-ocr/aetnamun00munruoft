passed over this far more pertinent source of illustration and comparison.
Our poem then was written before 79, and as I cannot anyhow believe
it to be older than the silver age, its time would exactly tally with the
time of Lucilius. The poem too is evidently written by one who was
well acquainted with Etna and its neighbourhood, and had seen its
eruptions and their consequences: now Lucilius was long governor of
Sicily. I find too more than one indication that the writer had a
practical knowledge of war and public business. More than once 111 the
commentary I have noted how fond he is of comparing the ravages of
Etna with those of an enemy. The most curious passage is 464—474,
which ο, first renders intelligible: to the poet, a spectator of the scene,
Etna suggests the notion of a victorious enemy attacking the terrified
bystanders at the same time with missiles and at close quarters. The
picture looks as if drawn by a practised observer of battles, not by a
mere closet-poet. Now Lucilius would appear, as we said above, to have
served under Lentulus Gaetulicus commander in Upper Germany, at
that time one of the best schools of Roman war, where he might have
had many opportunities of seeing the barbari-ans falling under the swords
and missiles of the legions and strewing the field of battle in the manner
here described The curious metaphor too in YS 258 259 strikes me
as written by one who had practical experience o'f such scenes. The poet
moreover speaks as an eyewitness of the neighbourhood of N aples 3 and
Seneca talks to Lucilius of ‘Pompeios tuos’, and ‘ Parthenope tua’ as if
Lucilius had some close connexion with those parts, All this shews of
course only that he might have been, not that he was the author.
Besides the passage about Etna in Seneca’s 7 9th epistle which we
have discussed above, Wernsdorf and Jacob to prove the author to be
Lucilius allege the fact as they say that he was an epicurean and the
writer of the poem was an epicurean. This question they treat with
great carelessness and confusion of thought? Jacob refers to no less
than seven passages to prove that the poet was a follower of Epicurus
Five of these merely advise you to use your eyes and senses in judging
of what is going 0n; and this a stoic could do as well as an epicurean;
nay a believer in Zeno of Elea, as well as a partisan of Zeno of Citium:
the other two passages directly disprove what he asserts. Not to dwell
on minor pointS‚ there are three passages 111 13116 poem, each distinctly
enuntiating a leading stoical doctrine: first, 33-35, where the divinity
of the stars is maintained: this a peripatetic indeed might have held as
well as a stoic 3 certainly -not an epicurean. The 2nd passage is 173 174,
where the end of the present state of things and the return of the world
to its original state are hinted at, in exact conformity with the teaching
of the 6130165, 111 direct contradiction to that of Epicurus who taught that
our world would one day pass away into its constituent atoms and be
