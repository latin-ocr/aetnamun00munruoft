Ἡδύλος ἐστὶν κ.τ.λ. ἀρχή δ’ οῧν τοῦ δυσμικοῧ παράπλου τό Κούριον τοῦ
βλέποντος πρὸς Ῥόδον, καὶ εὐθύς ἐστιν ἄκρα ἀφ’ ἧς ῥίπτουσι τούς ἁψαμένους
τὀΰ βωμοῦ τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος. This must have been the headland Φρούριον
mentioned by Ptolemy V 13 just before Kozipcov3 and the whole of the
small peninsula of Κούριον must have been assigned to the worship of
Apollo Hylates: Steph. Byz. Ἀμαμασσός· πόλις Κύπρου ἐν ᾗ τιμᾶται
“Υλάτης Ἀπόλλων; Ἐρύσθεια· πόλις Κύπρου ἐν ᾗ Ἀπόλλων τιμᾶται ’Υλοί-
της. Διονύσιος Βασσαρικῶν τρίτῃ, Οἵ τ’ ἔχον ιΥλοῖταο θεοῦ ἕδος Ἀπόλ-
λωνος, Τέμβρον Ἐρύσθειάν τε καὶ εἰναλίην Ἀμαρυσσόνῖ Τέμβρος· πόλις
Κύπρου ἐν ᾗ τετίμηται εΥλοίϊης Ἀπόλλων. The conspicuous position of
the peninsula in question must have made this name of Apollo well-
known in Alexandrine and Roman times The nam-e recalls what Pau-
sanias Χ 32 6 says, speaking of Magnesia upon Maeander or Lethaeus,
ἔστι δὲ καὶ τοῖς ἐπὶ ποταμῷ Ληθαίῳ Μάγνησιν ἲΥλαι καλούμενον χωρίον·
ἐνταῦθα Ἀπόλλωνι οἷνεῖται σπήλαιον, μεγέθους μὲν ἕνεκα οὖ πολλοῦ θαύ-
ματος, τὸ δὲ ἄγαλμα τοῦ ’Λπόλλωνος τοῖ μάλιστα οἶρχαῖοντ the similarity
of names and worship would seem to imply some connexion. In pre-
Alexandrine times Cyprus was more than half-barbarian: when it
became the chief possession of the Egyptian crown, doubtless Apollo
HylateS, little known to old Greece, would be celebrated by other Alex· ·
andrine writers besides Lycophron‚——writers now lost but accessible to
our author, who, as we shall often have occasion to see, was a man of
varied learning.

6 Ι now come to the Dodona of mss, which cannot be right, as
Apollo had no business there. It once occurred to me that Dardania,
in the Roman sense, might be the right reading : the whole of that coast
teeined with his sanctuaries: comp. Strabo 618 παρὰ πᾶσαν γάρ δή τὴν
παραλίαν ταύτην ὁ Ἀπόλλων ἐκτετίμηται μέχρι Τενέδου, Σμινθεῦς ἢ Κυλ-
λιῖος καλούμενος ἢ Γρυνεύς ἥ τινα ἄλλην ἐπωνυμίαν ἔχωνῑ Statius Theb. 1
699 in the middle of a similar address, ‘Seu Troiam Thymbraeus habes'.
But the true reading I now feel sure is Ladonis ‘the daughter of
Ladon' : perhaps our author after some poet of Antioch may have used
the form Ladona on the analogy of Hesiod's Ἀμφιτρυώνη and similar
female patronymics What has just been said of the poets and writers
of Alexandria, applies more strongly to those of Antioch and Daphne:
they have perished and desei-vedly so no doubt 3 yet there are many
testimonies to shew that for six or seven centul-ies Daphne not only in
splendour and beauty, but in fame as well, had taken the place of
Delphi, as chief sanctuary of Apollo. But it is not in Euripides or
Pindar that we read of this : we have to go to Philostratus, Galen, Liba-
nius, Chrysostom, Sozomen, Nonnus, J ustin, Servius and the like. The
origin of Apollo's worship there is told by J nstin xv 4 1 ‘Seleucus
nouus Antigono hostis accesserat. huius quoque uirtus clara et origo
