used with studied point: ‘in order that ‘that which is to draw together
a considerable stream, may draw its supplies out of a full store’: the

‘quidam existimant terram quoque...nova fluminum capita detegere

of small print to expound these three vss. and the result produced by a
lively imagination acting on inferior mss. is as follows: Non Nili ex

somewhat similar is Lucan VI 101 ‘mixta iacent incondita uiuis Cor-
