enumerated in the new catalogue, vol. 111 p. 703—7062 I give here some
details not mentioned there.

The volume we now have is but half the original manuscript: it
commences with quaternion lx: the quaternione are all marked at the
bottom of the last page of each, Ix Χ XI ΧΠ XIII: then follow 7 leaves of
the next one: the last leaf has its lower half cut off: it contained no
doubt the portrait of the SORIPTOR QUI SCRIPSIT‚ which has been pilfered by
some unscrupulous collector. Our poem occupies 33 pages, viZ. the last
two leaves of quaternion XII, the whole of XIII, the next six leaves, and
the first page of the last imperfect leaf : page one contains the heading
of the poem and 19 verses, the next 31 contain 20 verses each, the last
page has 6 verses of the poem and the subscription. The lines in this
edition are numbered in the order they come in α. which has 645 verses:
the two additional ones in β are reckoned as supernumeraries. α. came
into our library with the rest of Bishop More of Ely's magnificent col-
lection in 17153 and is the codex Eliensis cited by Davies in his Cicero
de natura: it cannot be later than the lOth century 3 and appears to
have been written in England, as some of the modern poems in it are
concerned with the literary squabbles of this country. Indeed Μι-
Bradshaw our Librarian thinks it possible that in piece 7 ‘versus L de
quodam superb0'‚ the L is Lantfredus or Lanfridus, a disciple of Bishop
Ethelwold of winchester, at that time the chief seat of English learning.
If this be so, our ms. cannot be earlier than the end of the lOth century:
to me it appears to be earlier. It is beautifully and for the age accu—
rately written 3 the words are correctly divided, except that, in con-
sormity with the ancient pronunciation, the atonics, such as et, qui, ozon,
and the monosyllabic prepositions are often united with the word that
follows: odora ut for odor aut, opera erudibus for operae rudibus, foyer
etuentos for (hyeret uentos, inclusis olidum for inclusi solidum stand quite
by themselves. There are few contractions, except those which are
common in the oldest and best codices: thus we often, but by no means
always, meet with the usual abbreviations of per, pro, prae, que, est,
quod, of the final m, and mm in the middle of words, of -tur in the pre-
sent passive, and -bus in the dat. or abl. plur. Single or rare instances of
⁶25, οἷῆε, 3233, tris, viris, αφῆέ-ἱα (amentia) occur. The spelling is on tho
whole very good and I have followed it in all but palpable corruptions:
even lmmor and sulphur I have retained as they may be from the
author: barbarisms like Aetiona, caetera, aeglesias, inficior are very rare:
milia is spelt rightly: millia once where the reading is otherwise cor-
rupt: ae is generally correctly given, preceps and the like being the
exceptions. With good reason then, as already observed, I have noted
its minutest variations. The manuscript has been corrected throughout,
but at rare intervaIs, by a contemporary hand: c and p, η and r, rc and
