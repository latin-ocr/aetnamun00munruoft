admirabilis fuit, siquidem mater eius Laudice, cum nupta esset Antio-
cho claro inter Philippi duces uiro, uisa sibi est per quietem ex concu-
bitu Apollinis concepisse grauidamque factam cet. Ubi post mortem
Alexandri occupato regno orientis urbem condidit, ibi quoque geminae
originis memoriam consecrauit. nam et urbem ex Antiochi patris
nomine Antiochiam uocauit et campos uicinos Apollini dicauit’. Seleu-
cus in 300 Β. c. founded at the same time Antioch‚ which Chrysostom a
native proudly terms the κεφαλή καὶ μήτηρ of all the cities of the east,
and at five miles distance, higher up the Orontes, the park and sanctuary
of Daphne which Chrysostom, Ammian and others so often call a suburb
of Antioch. Daphne was no less famous than Antioch, which on coins,
in inscriptions and books is as often called Antioch by Daphne, Antioch
of Daphne, as Daphne is termed Daphne by Antioch: καὶ πάντα ἦν ἧ
Δάφνη Σελεύκῳ, says Libanius in his Antiochicus. Chrysostom, while
invidiously contrasting the earthly Daphne with the heavenly Jerusa-
lem, cannot conceal what charms it had for the children of this world.
To Antioch and Daphne was transplanted the whole worship of Apollo:
unable to create, the Syrian Greeks brought hither the very names
of old Hellas, Castalia and the like : an omphalos, far larger than that of
Delphi, was set up by Antiochus Epiphanes or Epimanes in the middle
tetrastylon of his great central street of colonnades‚ Ausonius, de clar.
urb. 3, says ‘ Phoebeae lauri domus Antiochia.’

But on the banks of the Orontes Daphne was always called daughter
of Ladon: nay the very river was transferred to Syria, like Castalia.
Why2 was Laodice connected with the Peloponnese and the parts of it
where the Ladon flowed2 Much else was brought from thence to Syria.
On the hill Silpion was an old Syrian Ione, on which Seleucus Nicator
sacrificed to Zeus Ceraunius in the spring of 300, before founding
Antioch. This gave rise to the notion of an Argive-Athenian colony
sent to recover Io, ancl to other tasteless pervensions of the genuine my-
thology. Ladon is a fine river, but not better than twenty others in the
‘great Dorian island of Pelops’ 3 and in the unperverted legend was
known as father of Metope famous in the mythical history of Thebes
and Hellas: see Pindar olymp. VI and his scholiast, and Diodorus IV 72.
Even in Ovid and Hyginus we know Daphne only as daughter of
Peneus. But Antioch changed all this: Pausanias VIII ‘20 1 thus writes:
ὅ δὲ Λάδων ποταμῶν τῶν ἐν Ἑλλάδι ὕδωρ παρέχεται· κάλλιστον, ἔχει δὲ καὶ

ἄλλως ἐς ἀνθρώπους φήμην καὶ wi ᾀδόμενα ἐς τήν Δάφνην. τοῦ λόγου δὲ ·

τοῦ ἐς Δάφνην τοῖ μὲν Συρίοις τοῖς οἰκοῦσιν ἐπὶ Ὀρόντῃ ποταμῷ παρίημι
κ.τ.λ. What was told by the Syri-ans on the Orontes? Philostratus in
his life of Apollonius 1 16 p. 19 will throw some light on this: ἐπεφοίτησε
καὶ Ἀντιοχείᾳ τῇ μεγάλῃ πεπαυμένος τοῦ σιωπᾶν, καὶ παρῆλθεν ἐς τό ἱερὸν
τοῦ Δαφναίου Ἀπόλλωνος, ᾧ περιάπτουσιν Ἀσσύριοι τᾶν μῦθον τὸν Ἀρκάδα·
