in spite of her terror: perhaps in the last V. there was something to
which this refers, such as ‘matrem 1116 labantein': Claud. ib. 9 ‘Nonne
uides ut sacua senex incendia monstret, Vt trepido genetrix inuocet ore
deos ’1 Erexit formido comani perque omne metallum Fusus in attonito
palluit aere treinor': or else we must read ‘Tutus uterque pio sub
pondere sufficit illo'. 640 comp. Conon, etc. cited above, and Pausan.

As Ι promised in the introduction, Ι append some remarks on
Professor Haupt’s program of 1554: p. 3 116 thus emends 51 foll:
Inpius et miles metuentia comminus astra Prouocat, admotis ad territa
sidera signis Prouocat infestus cunctos ad proelia diuos. Iuppiter e*
caelo metuit dextramque corusca Armatus flamina cet: ad carrica is,
he says, a correction of Eueruinus W⁷assenbei·gliiiis: the transposition of
52 and 53 is his own. c caelo metuit 116 defends by Propert. v 6 59
‘pater Idalio miratur Caesar ab asti-0⁹: to 1116 1116 context seems to
require caelo metuit: I prefer too the coruscam of all mss. P. 4 in 60
116 reads ad for iu: but with in bellandum may we not compare such
expressions as Ovid her. 15 197 ‘ N on mihi respondent ueteres 111 carmina
uires’, Aen. VII 664 ‘ Pila manu saeuosque gerunt in bella dolones’, and
‘in utrumque paratus’.Z (52 116 reads laeuus for saeuus: Ι prefer sccccuu33
but both corrections at once occurred to nie, and would occur to any
scholar: in the sanie v. he proposes utrimque secu-s· sor uto-imque (Zeus.
In 68 he adopts the reading of a 16111 century edition, Ampleaea esc
natos for Impellens uictos: but that is surely rewriting, not correcting:
quc too seems in that case a most inadequate connecting particle. I
do not see that it is inore absurd to picture Earth carried along in
the rout of her children, as she attempts to rally them, than to
represent the stars as fighting on the side of heaven. P. 5 in 19 he
proposes Ambustam (izit or Ambustwn auc for Inpositam et. P. 6 in 73
he prefers patulis of Aldus. 76 116 reads uatum sor rerum. 77 nisyro
uiderunt aymine for oiim-03 uiderunt carmine. P. 7 111 80 he proposes
