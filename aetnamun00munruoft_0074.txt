‘guiltless of plunder’: the sense wanted seems to be ‘ unharmed’, which
innoxia can by itself have. I regret not to be able to throw more light
on this paragraph, but, assisted by α, Ι have not treated it like other
editors, who with all their violent emendations, seem none of them, not
even Scaliger, to connect it rationally with what precedes and follows.
358—424: whether the cause then come from without or from
within, eruptions of fire, sand, stones and molten rocks are frequent:
material never fails: if there is a lull, it is from the openings being
blocked up; and when this resistance is broken through, the eruption
is rendered more violent: many mineral substances help; but above all
the lapis molaris or lava-stone feeds the eruption: its power of retaining
fire is very great3 and it cau be rekindled again and again. 358 pere-
9rz'nis: the causes last spoken of which 116 admits to be possible3 but
not so likely as the propriae, the internal causes, described before.

aliquando multo igne abundauit, ingentem uim harenae urentis effudit...
illo tempore aiunt tunc plurima fuisse tonitrua et fulmina, quae con-
cursu aridorum corporum facta sunt, non nubium cet.' ι and srayoris can
well go together with ficlmina: comp. Sen.nat. quaest. 11 27 3 ‘talia
eduntur tonitrua, cum cet. hic proprie fragor dicitur, subitus et vemens,

4 times brachia, twice bracchia. 3¹72 operae Scaliger takes for the
