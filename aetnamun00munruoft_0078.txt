river Symaethus sometimes and bury its banks twenty feet deep. 448

efflant i. 0. uaporem: it is used thus absolutely by Lucr. VI 681 ‘Flamma
foras efflet'3 Stat. Theb. x109 ‘niger efflat anhelo Ore uapor’, who
more than once thus uses the partic. 452 I nt. nen. must mean ‘im-
miscentur uenis Aetnae’3 but I know no other instance of this use of
the word. 454 colligsit makes no sense, 31111 seems to have come from
colleyib of 455: Ι read conjicit which 111 capitals differs little from con-
liffl't: ‘dearth of the molaris makes the fires to be meagre’: comp. 427

‘genus 1100 lapidis...Quod nullas adiunxit opeS, elanguit ignis’. 455
iacit i. e. flammas. 457 here too α alone points to the truth: the

effects of the lapis molaris, when the fury of the eruption is abated,
si lenitur (opus), are not so wonderful in the appearance they present to
us outside the mountain, extra: rather is it, when it is on fire in the
crater, illic, and sets in flames all about it that its terrors are shewn.
equidem, not with the first person contrary to the older usage: Persius,
probably a contemporary, has also two well-known instances3 but most
of those given by Hand in his Tursellinus are quite apocryphal. qua is -
the abl. of quality: comp. Lucr. v 577 ‘nilo fertur maiore figura, Quam,
nostris oculis qua cernimus, esse uidetur'. 458 illic seems emphatic:
there inside the crater. 459 samum, lapis molaris. 461 uiris of σ,
clears away much vain conjecture: lapis molaris must be the nomin„ as
clearly one or more vss. are lost here: then in 462 ramis must be cor-
rupt: I conjecture rupes or rather rupis: with ramis then sor ‘rupis
comp. 594 camilli αω sor capilli: forms like nomin. ‘rupis are common
enough: Christ keeps nomin. uatis 111 the de diuin. 1112 and 13 after
the best mss. and Buechler uolpz's in Petron. 583 and many similar cases
occur: for the sense comp. 455 456, espec. ‘ictu Materiam accendit

than morta] 3 as 557 ‘sacro numquam non fertilis igni'3 and 559 ‘caelo
propior’: perhaps we may compare 194 ‘arcent aditus diuinaque rerum
Cura: sine arbitrio est’: or to be used as in ‘Di magni, horribilem
et sacrum libellum’ and the like. 466 honerosa of ο, I keep: honus,
honerosus, honustus were all in common use: the uncritical Gellius
attests this: though his reasons are worthless, his facts are not: 113
‘inserebant eam [le] ueteres nostri plerisque vocibus uerborum firmandis
roborandisque...sic honera, sic honustum dicebant’: so Plaut. Stich. 276

the Ιι was so well established that a fanciful derivation was invented
to explain it. 46¹7 moles: comp. 27 and 11. there. 468 Prouol-
