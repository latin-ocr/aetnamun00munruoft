as though it nevel had been. The third passage is 537 foll. where the
poet lecommends the‘ verissima dict-1⁵ of Helaclitus' obscure book, that

311 0111031033, than the many close 1111113110118 of the same writer by the
stoie BIanilius prove it of him. If then Lucilius was 311 epicurean when
our 110031 was written, he did not write it. It is with reference mainly
to this point that I have gone through Seneca’s letters. I will give a
summary of the results I 113νο obtained: if Ι were to state the evidence
at length, I should have to fill many pages 11 1111 extr acts.

the very last of Seneca’s letters, refusing 10 accept some of the most ex-
treme stoical paradoxes. That during any period of their correspond-
ence Lucilius was a professed epicuream, Ι (10 1101 believe: even in 1110
03111081 letters Seneca often speaks of Epicurus and his sect, as he could ·
hardly have done 10 311 intimate friend who was at the same time 3
decided epicurean. Yet from several indications it would appear that
Lucilius was favourably inclined 10 11118 school: once, epist. 23 9, Seneca
writes ‘vocem tibi Epicuri tui reddere’: compare the ‘Ouidius tuus’
already spoken of: in the 107111 01118110 we have ‘Epicurus noster': the
68th epistle too 1138 111010 111311 one expression, indicating some relation
between Lucilius and Epicurus. But all this 18 very far from showing
that Lucilius was a professed believer in Epicurus ς and indeed frcim first

supposition: no epicureah could have held the doctrines about provi-
dence, the gods etc. which 8011003 attributes to 1118 friend even at the
beginning of their correspondence. It seems clear enough then that
Lucilius was, like many of his countrymcn, 311 eclectio, with a distaste
for the iron consistency of the Greek speculative spirit, finding much
to approve and something to dislike in each of the rival schools of Epi-
curus and the Porch, then the most popular systems in Rome. Seneca
himself shrunk from some of the extremest stoica] paradoxes and owed
much to the more human and humane teaching of Epicurus. We learn
from Gellius that there were at least two more books of Seneca’s letters
to Lucilius, but at the end of the twenty extant Lucilius is still a
doubter of the truths of 8101018111. However it is possible enough that
further reflexion and the subsequent death of Seneca may have produced
full conviction in 1110 generous spirit of Lucilius. If then there was
