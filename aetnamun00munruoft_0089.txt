sollicitamque siti’3 but ‘pomo’ and ‘siti’ make a strange apposition.
84 he adopts J acob's ulterius and reads ‘ Quidquid et ulterius falsi
sibi conscia terrent’, which I confess I cannot interpret, any more than
in 23 ‘Quidquid in antiquum iactata est fabula carmen’. P. 9 111 1001
116 proposes ‘Dantque uiam, sanguis omnis qua commeet, isdem Terra
cet.’‚ changing four words. P. 10 in 110 116 reads uetustas for uetusta
est. 111 for intra he gives ultra. 119 for too-vens uno he offers
totiens imo, which I cannot approve. 123 for riuis he reads ripis,
saying of the ms. reading ‘nemo semel monitus negabit 11666 esse
ineptissima’: Hor. epod. 11 2 25 had suggested to me 111118,- and now I
admit that riuis can scarcely be defended. 269 foll. he emends thus:
Sic auidi semper quod uisum est carius, istis Inplemus se quisque bonis.
ast artibus illis Sunt animi fruges 3 haec rerum est optima merces, cet.
273 116 prefers mutum. P. 12 111 281 116 adopts ‘iuncto foedere' from
Mencken and Schrader. 287 coqitur, which I at once hit upon for
the unmeaning cogitat, I find from Haupt to be an emendation of
Schrader. P. 13 in 291 for sono he gives sinu. 293 for the ‘ora
duc’ of α 116 suggests doubtingly ‘ora lacus’ or ‘em-ipus'. 567 for
⁴ uiuit per’ he proposes ‘uincuntur'. P. 14 he says of 311 ‘cum nullo
artificio effici posse uideatur ut ffcmlere recte positum esse censeamus
non dubitamus poetam ita scripsisse Aut humore etiam nebulas sc
fundere largo': to me this alteration appears to destroy the whole
sequence of the argument. P. 15 in 312 Ι find mysclf anticipated in
reading adluit for abluit: the certainty of the correction is sels-evident.
314 α has not Flamina, which in my opinion must not be read. 325
he adopts certantes from Jacob for ardentes, uenas of Aldus for uires:
my conception of the passage is quite different. P. 16 111 439 for
durata of mss. he reads clarata est: a conjecture upset I think by my
explanation of the whole sentence. 426 for nascentis he proposes
pascentis, which he afterwards found Schrader had done: it is odd that
I too had written down pascentis ; but rejected it on account of the
passage which he brings in support of it, 447 ‘pasceret ig11es'3 and
the still more decisive 453 ‘Pabula et ardendi causam lapidem esse
molarem’3 from which Ι inferred the poet meant to say that the
variety of material which sprung up in those placeS‚ sulphur, alumen,
ete. was greater 3 but for want of the true pabulum, the lapis molaris,
the fires had gone out. 449 I have gladly accepted testem. P. 18 111
360 for subuectat he reads subiectat after Lucr. vl 700 ‘ Saxaque subiec-
tare': and it certainly is a more appropriate word. The poet however
may have been thinking of georg. 111 241 ‘nigramque alte subiectat
[P subuectat ill R] harenam’3 and if his Virgil, as is likely enough,
agreed with the Medicean and Roman, he may have used subuectat 011
the authority as he thought of Virgil. 362 for ‘Ardentis-que simul
