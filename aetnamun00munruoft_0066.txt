neglect of what is before us and therefore more concerns us? 257 foll.
we search and torment the earth for gain, but will not examine it for
nobler ends: β has happily 276 277 278 111 this place: in α ω they have
the place noted by their numbers, in the middle of an alien sentence:
older editors may be excused 3 but in Jacob who knew the fact it shews
strange want of acumen not to obey β; 110, WVernsdorf, GoraHus, Scaliger
all put the vss. in unsuitable places. By a metaphor of somewhat far-
setched point the poet compares the earth, mined for its metals, to a
wretch put to the torture to extort confession. But the readings of β
are clearly inferior to those of α, which here has not a letter wrong 3 for
in 275 I prefer premimur, a favourite word of our poet, to the weaker
terinmr, β having above read tremit for premit: though here it may
indicate a different recension. 276 profundum editors strangely take to
be the sea: it is of course the depths of earth, as often in our poem: 546
‘ et quaedam fortasse profundo Incomperta iacent’ 3 578 ‘raptumque
profundo': he speaks of mining of course. 277 ary. seneen: Ovid has
‘ semina fcrri', but not with quite the same force. 278 Τονφιεηεαν of
αω, ‘are put to the torture’, 15 clearly right: with these three lines
comp.Lucr. V1808 ‘ubi argenti uenas aurique secuntur, Terrai penitus
scrutantes abdita ferro' 3 and especially Pliny 11 157, who dwells 011 the ,
same metaphor, ‘aquis, ferro, ligno, igni, lapide, fruge omnibus cruciatur
horis... Vt tamen quae summa patiatur atque extrema cute tolerabilia
uideantur, penetramus in uiscera auri argentique uenas et aeris ac plumbi
metalla fodientes, gemmas etiam et quosdam paruolos quaerimus lapides
scrobibus in profundum actis. uiscera eius extrahimus’. 258, con-
tinuing the metaph. : the earth is tortured, like a poor wretch by robbers,
until it buy itself off, and then having confessed the truth, i. e. told
where its treasures are, is left to contempt and poverty and allowed to
hold its tongue: β 15 clearly corrupt in 259: taceant too is much more
pointed than iaceam. 261 o. ω are unintelligible at the end of this v.:
the change to the lst person is somewhat harsh: ‘we carefully weigh,
ponder over'. 263 platanis of αω 5001115 better than plantis of β, but
15 not certain. 267 Horrea is accus: with this change of subject
comp. 2733 and Lucr. V 1266 ‘Vt sibi tela darent siluasque ut caedere
possent'. (lolem I retain with a: Orelli inser. 4888 ‹Zolearia 3 vol.2 p.
381 doleat the best mss. of Florus have doleam : 500 Jahn p. xxxi : perhaps
we might compare ledaea, labium and the like. 268 faenilia all the
best mss. of Virgil thus spell in geor. 111 321. 269 they are ever full
of greed, where anything has shewn itself more precious than what they
have. 270 illae cet.: some profit and enrich the intellect: Persius v 63
‘ purgatas inseris aures Fruge Cleanthea' ε 50 herc ‘ animus inseritur bona
fruge’. Ῐιαε cet.: others have a practical value: leae of α must be right:
