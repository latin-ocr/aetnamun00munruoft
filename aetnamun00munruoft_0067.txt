2¹72 quod I adopt from ε 3 as quid coercet seems quite inadmissible: see
n. to 229. 273 Nul. fid. op. [nos]‚ [nos] non mutos cestu: see n. to
267. 279 marnpi: mundi of αω has no sense. 280 impediat of αω
Ι explain by 318—328: i. 6. the obstacles stir the winds to fury, and so
cause the violent eruption: comp. too 379 ‘ mora uelocius urgent'. 281
multo foed. pax: Tac. hist. 1 77 and lv 35 ‘multa pace'. 282 clearly
one or more vss. are lost here: probably more than one. Ι cannot-
follow Jacob, who transfers 301 302 before 282, and then has to alter
both 301 and 282: he seems to me to invert the poet’s reasoning, and
moreover the subjunctives crescant, seruent, abstrahat are then inex-
plicable. 284 tenues of β 13 undoubtedly true. 285 riyido cet.:
comp. my correction of 182 ‘penitusque os erigit ultra’ : it seems pretty
clear that Aetna was mentioned in what is lost before 282, as he is here
talking of the various ways in which winds may get within the moun-
tain. Lucretius in his brief description of Etna gives much weight to
wind 3 but our poet treats of it at quite inordinate length: he has
already said much about it, and continues the subject for another 100
lines. 286 uentis is the last gain we get from β, which ends here.
287 it is thus forced to admit from all sides different winds ,· because the
summit is equally exposed to all. coqitat has no meaning here: coqz'tur
seems quite necessary, the -ur was absorbed in the following auras, or
lost by abbreviation: 00in then passed into cogsz‘tat. 288 and then
instead of battling, the winds join forces and so exert a greater power.
289 another possible cause: he now speaks of and illustr-ates the
effect of moisture or water in stimulating wind or air, which 111611 111 113
turn excites something else, in the case of Etna its fires: ‘or else the
clouds and cloudy south drive the winds inward into the mountain:’ but
these 1733. are very obscure 3 and Jacob and others here go much astray,
illustrating from Lucretius what is totally different. 290 a 3rd
cause: fleaeere and ferantur clearly refer to nubes ec nub. aus.; I have
therefore for the syll. wanting written hi, but, as I do not know what
our poet's usage would be, perhaps haec would be right 3 or again ut,
‘ when haply', might better connect the v. with what follows: then flex.
caput is obscure, though the general meaning is clear: ‘or else these
clouds, etc. wheel about and take the winds behind, and so drive them
in': in 289 they met them in front: fleaeere caput, for flexere se, seems a
doubtful expression3 so that perhaps Wernsdorf is right in taking it to
mean have rounded‚ doubled, the head of Etna, comparing the technical
‘ flectere promunturium', ‘ fleo. Leucaten'. 291 unda is the water from
the clouds: then this water pressea drives before it the airs and condenses
them with its blows and so increases their force: Torpentes seems neces-
sary: I do not find torrentes in the sense of ‘ streaming' applied to aught
but liquids, or speech. 293 now follow two illustrations from artificial
