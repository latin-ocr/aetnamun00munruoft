st, α and e, a and o are among the letters most commonly interchanged,
evidently from these letters respectively being not easy to distinguish in
some archetype of the inferior mss. as well as a: by this confusion of a
with e and o Ι explain for instance in 6 Dodona for Ladonis and in 522
portam for partem.

The immense superiority of o. over all the later mss. is seen through-
out the poem: in 50 places it makes sense of what in them is quite
unintelligible, and in many other places points out the right road to
emendation,- while it is only in a few trivial or accidental cases where
they have any advantage over α, as in 19 where the copyist for matrem?
reads mentem, the (lentem of 20 having caught his eye. Thus α alone
gives 5 and 6 111 the right ordei-5 ο. alone has the whole verses 61 ‘In
commune—Pallas', 469 470 ‘Illinc—pugnae'j the half lines 53 ‘ que—
signis’, 60 ‘Atque in bellandu1n'‚ 327 ‘siphonibus actus', 355 ‘plantis
—praedas', 445 ‘Siculi uicinia inontis', 384 ‘ Si cessata diu referunt'3
the following words and phrases, making sense out of the nonsense of
other 11133, 69 ‘cessat', 85 ‘Nec tu, terra’, 95 ‘incingitur’, 105 ‘tortis’,
107 ‘chal-ybelis', 121 ‘uenas’, 310 ‘crescere’‚ 312 ‘abluit’ i.e. ‘adluit',
332 ‘fulgeat', 352 ‘nost1·is'‚ 373 ‘quae rumpat iter' anticipated by the
acumen of Scaliger, 435 ‘bitumine ², 436 ‘generandis', 457 ‘facie’, 461
‘uiris’, 476 ‘ faex', 483 ‘feruere’, 485 ‘prunis' i.e. ‘pronis', 490 ‘amnis’‚
507 ‘Symaethi', 512 ‘fiuere’, 513 fFlumina , 538 ‘Heraclite‚ tui’, 549
‘praeclususque’, 575 ‘intersumus', 582 ‘soli', 586 ‘est philomela’, 645
‘Sed curae’ i. e. ‘Securae'. In a few cases some of the more interpolated
of the late mss. are right or nearly right with a, while γ ὃ ε are all corrupt,
as 117 ‘non credit inanis', 138 ‘ Intereepta’, 430 ‘testisque ', 526 ‘refel-
lit', 60 ‘potentia diuum’: in 625 the correct ‘Amphinomus’ osy aud ε
probably comes from conjecture. What I have quoted is but a part of
what α. does for our poem 3 yet great as its excellence is compared with
the others, it is clear from every page of my critical notes that they and
α. all belong to the same family: some original from which γδεζ etc.
come, got mutilated in parts: this original and α had both some common
progenitor, removed from them not many degrees. This will be still
plainer when I have described the fragment I eall β.

The history of this fragment which has long disappeared is very
obscure and uncertain: it 13 not always easy to determine what its read-
ings are, owing to the clumsy way in which they have been handed down
in two different repertories, one meant to be supplement-ary to the other.
The older of these is XValchius' Acta societ. lenensis vol. v for 1756,
pp. 3—-6, a very imperfect collation: the second 13 found in the Neue
Bibliothek der schoenen XVissenschaften vol. 59 pp. 311-327, where
F. C. Matthiae supplies what was omitted in the other place from a
fuller collation sent to him by Kulenkamp‘⁴ and taken from the margin
