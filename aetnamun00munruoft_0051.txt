describes a grease very efficacious in curing baldness. The recipe was
found after the owner’s death, ἐν πυκτίὸι διφθέρᾳε it was written in
figurative language not easy to interpret. Galen attempts this with
apparent success3 but yet with regal-d to each of the other ingredients
he will only say ‘I think it means so and so'; as when he acutely
explains ‘a pound of fat from a shapeless child' to mean a pound of
grease from a young bear before its mother had licked it into shape.
One of the ingredients however, p. 423, 15 λαδωνίὸος φύλλων ἁπαλῶν
χυλοῦ, of which he says, p. 426, λαὸωνίδος δὲ, ὅτι τῆς δάφνης λέγει, οὐκ ἂν
οἶμαί τινα διαπαρῆσαιε 50 world-renowned* at that time was the daughter
of Ladon. By whom chiefly or when she got this renown I cannot tell:
perhaps πολλοὶ ψεύδονται ἀοιδοί, was all that could be said for the poets
of Antioch. The legend I doubt not was coeval with the foundation of
the city, and connected somehow with the family of Seleucus. But the
Museum of Antioch appears to have been of later celebrity. Cicero, pro
Archia 4, speaking of this native of Antioch says ‘se ad scribendi
studium contulit, primum Antiochiae (nam ibi natus est nobili loco),
celebri quondam urbe et copiosa atque eruditissimis hominibus liberalis-
simisque studiis affluenti‘. Archias among others may have helped to
give the story its great celebrity: Ovid did not know or neglected this
form of the legend. A comparison of the readings and comments of
Scaliger, Gorallus, Wernsdorf and Jacob would I think commend mine.

'7 Pierio: I am not sure that this has not reference to Antioch
and Daphne: north of them and the Orontes was a district and a moun-
tain both named Pieria: Strabo p. 749 Ἀντιόχεια ἦ ἐπὶ Δάφνῃ καὶ

prefer the ill-attested cautim.

9—28: the golden age and the legends of old times have been sung
so often, that they are as familiar as our own times to us all. I essay
something more real: to explain the movements and the fires of Ema—
