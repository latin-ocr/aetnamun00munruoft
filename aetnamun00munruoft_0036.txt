whether he has not now proved his point, the only point he has proved
being that 118 does not understand what he is talking about. But what
I have said by no means applies to all the notes; nor can any one
dispute that he has often rightly emended the corrupt text: 118 has
employed too much more judiciously than VVernsdorf the Florentine

fragment.
And now I come to the manuscripts which I have made use of: as

already said, this poem should never have been edited by me, if Ι had
not met with the manuscript in our public 'librati-y, Kk v 34, numbered
2076 in the new catalogue. This codex is so much superior to all other
existing codices both 111 age and 111 merit, that not only have Ι grounded
my text mainly 011 11, but as 111 duty bound have noted the minutest
discrepancies of spelling: Ι call it o.. Besidcs α Ι have colhated, and so
far as I know have been the first to collate, two manuscripts in the
British Museum: one which I call γ forms part of Arundel 133, a large
folio in double columns: the Aetna begins at leaf 92 b and ends at 96 b:
the lst column has 38 lines besides the heading, the last page contains
14 lines, all the other columns have 39 lines each. This codex is of the
l5th century, but belongs to the less interpolated class of late mss. and
is extremely like, though I think on the whole rather better than
J acob's ms. 3, which I denote by e: my critical notes will shew fully
their relation to each other. The second codex which Ι name ζ, 18
Sloane 777, art. 6, written on vellum in a small Italian hand late in 1118
15111 century. It belongs to the more interpolated class of mss. and
ascribes the poem to Cornelius Severus, which γ gives to Virgil: it
departs however less from α and the better mss. than Scaliger’s worth-
less codex and the early printed copies do. To these mss. Ι have joined
J acob’s two, his H which Ι call ὃ, and 1118 3 which Ι call ε. 8 was col-
lated for him by Lachmann3 and therefore, we may feel sure, with
accuracy. Though it is dated so late as 1470, 818 1118 best of the infe-
rior mss., better on the whole I think than γ and ε, 11111811 better than ζ,
or the early editions3 though, compared with α, 11 18 10 118 reckoned
merely among these. ε 18 assigned to the 14th century by 0118 Krantz,
to the end of the 13111 by one Wachler, as Ι learn from Hand, Stat. silv.
p. xxv: according to Hand it is the best extant ms. for Statius' silvae3
but it must Ι think belong really to the 15111 century. The variations
of γ δ εζ Ι have not given of course with 1118 same minuteness as those of
a: it would have been mere waste of space, and worse, to have done 8ο.
It is perhaps only the shortness of the poem that excuses my citing even
so much from them: usually, where they agree entirely or essentially
with one another, Ι denote them by ω, as Ι shall explain below. Before
I come to the lost Florentine fragment which I call β, Ι 1111181 describe α
more fully: the different pieces which the manuscript contains are
