Strabo p. 269 καὶ τοὶ περὶ τοὺς εὗσεβεῖς ἐκεῖ τεθρύληται τὸν Ἀμφίνομον
καὶ τόν Ἀναπίαν, οἳ τοὺς γονέας ἐπὶ τῶν ὤμων ἀράμενοι διέσωσαν ε’πι-
φερομένου τοῦ κακοῦ; 1110 001115 of Catina often represent two naked
figures, carrying each on their shoulders a draped figure, probably from
some famous statues: Olaudian has a poem to the pious brothers ancl

their statues. 625 Amphion of α and most mss. is 011110115. fortis,
nomin: see n. to 58. 627 senecta depends on (eressosz Scaliger joins
senecta membra, which may be right. 631 raperes& Ι read, as Ι do

not well 500 how rapiunt could have been changed to rapies: 500 11. 10 5
Delost: this use of est = 11001, 15 common in and after the Augustali age:
Hor. epist. 1 l 32 ‘ Est quadam prodire tenus’ 5 and Sat. 1 2 101 ‘Cois tibi
paene uidere est Vt nudam’, with the dat. as here3 for I join ‘illis
rapere est’: this booty‚ if none else, they may carry off. 634 pios:
‘ the pious brothers' appears to have been their proverbial title: Strabo
l. l. τοὺς εὖσεβεῖςε Pausan. X 28 4 ἐν Κατάνῃ τοῖς καλουμένοις εὖσεβέσιν.

636 Scaliger cites the ciris 27 ‘Felix illa dies, felix et dicitur annus':
this V. like much 111 0111 poem 15 abrupt and obscure: he must mean,
that day, disastrous as it waS‚ was rendered blessed by this deed of piety,
1110 ground they trod was unharmed, while all around was wasted:
Conon narrat. 43 gives a full account, and as he wrote in the time of
Augustus, it 15 very probable that our author had read the whole narra-
tive, of which we now have Photius’ abstract: I cite it, to illustrate our
poem from 605 10 1110 end: οἵτε Αἴτνης τοῦ πυρὸς κρατῆρες οἶνέβλυσοῖν
ποτε ποταμοῦ δίκην φλόγα κατοῖ τῆς χώρας, καὶ Καταναίοις...ἔδοξε παντελής
ἔσεσθαι φθοραὶ τῆς πόλεως· καὶ ‹in-6 ταύτης φεύγοντες ὥς εἶχον τάχους, οἱ
μὲν χρυσόν οἱ δὲ ἄργυρον ἔφερον, οἱ δὲ δ” τι τις βούλοιτο ἐπικούρημα τῆς
φυγῆς. Ἀναπίας δὲ καὶ Ἀμφίνομος ἀντὶ πάντων τοὺς γονεῖς γηραιοὺς ὄντας·
ε’πὶ τοὺς ὤμους ἀναθέμενοι ἔφευγον, καὶ τοὺς μὲν α”λλουςή φλὸξ ἐπικαταλα-
βοῦσα ἔφθειρεν, αὐτοὺς δὲ περιεσχίσθη τὸ πῦρ καὶ ὥσπερ νῆσος ἐν τῇ φλογὶ
πᾶς ὁ περὶ αὐτοὺς χῶρος ἐγένετο. Sui ταῦτα οἱ Σικελιῶται τόν τε χῶρον

Lycurgus κατοὶ Λεωκρ. 98, p. 160 λέγεται γοὶρ κύκλῳ τᾶν τόπον ἐκεῖνον

νῦν προσαγορεύεσθαι τὸν εὐσεβῶν χῶρονε 8011111155 15 says ‘ut sepulcri
locus nominaretur campus piorum': so that doubtless there was a notion
that where their tomb and. statues were shewn‚ there the 1110 first
divided and let them pass unharmed: hence probably ‘innoxia terra’:

lacuna here, such as this: Hortatur tollitque senem, matrem arripit
