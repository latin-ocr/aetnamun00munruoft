for our poem, though I do not think it is, I would suggest ‘uincit per
sidera'. 69 caelum: this pause before the final spondee is a marked
feature in the rhythm of our poem: comp. 76 189 192 209 216 270 319
393 412 513 500 60οῑ 3100 before a final bacchius, as 79 canentes, 416
projecto, 512 fazcillae: in more than one place the older editions are un-
intelligible through neglecting this. Editors from Scaliger to Jacob
have played strange tricks with our passage.

74—93: this is mere invention of poets, like the tales they tell of
things below, and above the earth. Though such lieence be fairly
claimed for poems, Ι prefer the truth: Etna will be my theme. ⁷ 74
poets have genius, hence their 11001110 are renowned: however in truth
plays and poems are mostly mere delusion. '77 uiderunt carmine can
scarcely be right: Ι conjecture uicerunt: ‘they have proved in song that
black manes exist beneath the earth and amid the ashes of the pyre’.
'78 this passage too has been much corrupted by wrong stopping: Atque
int. cin. clearly belongs to memes: the vulgar Roman belief being that
the moment the body was reduced to ashes, the spirit of the man entered
his manes i. e. a spectral resemblance of his body, like in feature, dress,
etc. to the living man. 79 St. undasque: our poem frequently has
que in the 3rd place 3 and editors, here and elsewhere, have corrupted it.
by overlooking this: comp. 113 ‘limo furtimque'3 172 ‘trepidant urbes-
(1110’3 409 ‘seruans aciem (1111·3111(11ῑο’3 430 ‘super testisque’ 3 528 ‘eadem
perque omnia'3 598 ‘operum turbaeque'3 599 ‘terra dubiusque': this
practice is common in Ovid, and to Lucr. 11 1050 Ι have given a great
many instances from him, and should have added to them lv 1010 ‘ per-
sectantes uisaeque uolantes’ i.e. persectantesque uolantes uisae: misled
by Nonius I there make accipitres, which is always masculine, feminine.
80 poena soed'mn, from the nature of the punishment: ‘fecundaque
poenis Viscera'. 81 Sollicitam comes clearly from the next v„ a com-
mon source of error in our as in other mss: comp. 234, 324, 378, 577,
311(1 α. at end of ⁴19: 311 epithet is needed for iuyera, and a verb for illi
cet: Plurima: (lant Ι suggest: poma for poena which probably came
from 80 is only the change of 0110 stroke, and in Tantalus' punishment
fruits of trees are usually joined with waters, as in Odyss. λ 582-592.
84 3 v. seems clearly lost here, such as ‘Pacem-a, materiem fingenda ad
talia praebet': cero-em of mss. 0011100 from the adjoining plural, so com-
mon a form of error in mss: so in 88 peccem for peccet 3 and 206 Ver-
tant α.. 0110 might look on the preceding verses as implying an epicu-
rean author: comp. Lucr. 111 978—1023: but here too we have the
stoic: comp. Seu. epist. 24 18 ‘non sum tam ineptus ut epicuream can-
