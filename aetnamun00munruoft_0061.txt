162 is very corrupt in all editions and mss, except β, whose reading Ι
113νο followed, only adding the in: a V. must be wanting here which I
will not venture to supply. 163 sese both α and βε other mss. and
all editions corrupt it. 165 166 β 11οΥ0 15 nearest the truth, then
α,· ω are all absurdly wrong: in β Ι only change aquasque to cwuatque,
which the sense demands: the constr. is ‘ubi in uacuo defit id qui (ablat.)
uacuum teneat uentos atque ita acuat morantes’. 167 Explicat scat-
ters them abroad and so destroys all their intensity. 168 turbare
is neut. as often in Lucretius and others. 169 170 can be understood
only in βε notusque premit densa ruina, premiturque uicissim nunc euri
boreaeque ruina, nunc uterque, i. e. eurus et boreas, ruina huius i. 0.
noti: the last words are but a repetition 10 fact of the premit of 169:
but he loves antithetical points: comp. n. to 53. 172 for position of
que comp. n. to 79. 174 antiqui i. e. mundi: ‘chaos is come again':
XVernsdorf and Jacob will have the author to be Lucilius, and an epicu-
rean ; and Jacob here refers to Lucretius: but clearly this is no doctrine
of Epicurus or 1115 followers: with them the world went back in a
moment into its primordial atoms ε here it is supposed to assume merely
its old chaotic form3 and this agrees exactly with the stoical theory:
comp. Sen. epist. 58 24 ‘mundus quoque, aeterna res et inuicta, mutatur
nec idem manet: quamuis enim omnia in se habeat quae habuit, aliter
habet quam habuit: ordinem. mutat’. ‘si fas est credere’ too of 173 is
very unepicurean: Lucretius on a similar topic says contemptuously,
VI 565, ‘ Et metuunt magni naturam credere mundi cet. l’ 175 Haec
immo: Tacitus often has immo 111 the 211 place. 176 uenas are the
canales or hollow ducts he speaks 50 much of above: 98 foll. 110 compares
these to the uenae of the body. 177 ‘ Etna gives proof of itsclf
that all may see': for this use of fides comp. 504 ‘plagis—fides'3 516
‘Et figulos huic esse fidem’: Jacob quotes Lucan Ι 523 ‘addita fati
Peioris manifesta fides'. 178 me elided: so 284 and 472 se: 110 is,ras
we have said, strictly Ovidian in his abstinence from harsh elisions. But
Ovid and all who are most strict 011 such points freely elide me, te, se,
cum, tum, iam and a few similar monosyllables. 181 foll. the eruptions,
their nature and materials being the main purpose of the poet, he comes
at once to describe the appearance of the crater, taking 00 notice of the
lower parts of the mountain. 181 aditus are the openings down into
the interior of the crater: 194 ‘ arcent aditus'. 182 Porriyit of β must
be right: Cor7·i9it of α and ω 000105 from the common confusion of c and p
in these mss. : but Ι doubt whether in the latter part of the v. we have
the genuine reading of β; it cannot be right 3 as from 181 till 187 he is
describing the form and appearance of the crater, the fitcies, (lomus, sedes
and area of such great workings, not the eruption and workings them-
selves: I therefore, for the ‘penitus quos exigit' of α, read ‘penitusque
