598 Ι add Haec, which may have fallen out from the Haec of 599:

comp. Stat. sil. Ι 347 ‘Vidi artes ueterumque manus uariisque metalla.
Viua modis. labor est auri memorare figuras Aut ebur aut dignas
digitis contingere gemmas, Quidquid et argento primum uel in aere
Myronis Lusit et enormes manus est experta colossos’: here ‘Myronis
manus' is used as in our poem: Aen. 1 455 ‘Artificumque manus inter
se operumque laborem Miratur’ ; Mart. IV 39 3 ‘Praxitelus manum
Scopaeque': Haupt 1. l. makes two corrections ‘uacca Myronis Et iam
mille manus’: manus too seems to want a genitive 3 and after Greek
painting has been illustrated by three of its greatest mastemieces, it is
hardly in keeping that a uaoea, however great its mel-its, shoqu be the
sole representative of Greek sculpture. turbaeque: for the position of
que see n. to 79 ι for the plur. turbae Haupt l. 1. compares Hor. od. 111 4
47 ‘ mortalisque turbas'‚ and Lat. Ilias 1020 ‘ turbis comitatus Achilles':
comp. too for the meaning Cic. Brutus 122 ‘quae uix iam comparet in
hac turba nouorum uoluminum' 3 Seu. epist. 88 24 ‘haec quoque libera-
lium artium turba'. >

599—645: yet the wonders of Etna surpass all these, Etna who can
spare as well as destroy: thus she gave a free passage through her fires
to the two brothers of Catina, who carried off, oue their father, the other ,
their mother, and thus earned eternal glory. 599 terra cet. i. e. ter-
raque dubius marique: see n. to 79: for a like question, and answer
without a connecting particle, comp. 540. 601 laum. rebus, in all that
is done by man. 602 i. e. in the beginning of autumn: here too ο.
alone is right. 603 the force of tamen seems to be, awful and far
above all works of man though it be, a human interest attaches to it in
the following story. 604 sons: though its acts are generally destruc-
tive. 609 torquet seems to mean ‘plagues' 3 though perhaps the poet
had more than one passage of Virgil in his mind: Iuppiter is its subject:
I doubt whether Scaliger-’s torpet would be in place, as the sky is then

rather in commotion. 611 rubebant first became mouebant or rubam,
then urebant. 612 hostem: see note to 469 470. 613 urbis,
Catina, which Etna has often invaded. 614 rapina seems to have here

its prim-ary meaning of snatching up to carry off: comp. Seu. epist. 74 7
‘nulli uero, etiam cui rapina feliciter cessit, gaudium rapti durauit in
posterum'. 617 raptis is used as rapina before: unable to carry away
what he had snatched up, he loses precious time in repeating vain
charius or formulae 3 for so I understand carmina. 618 minimo
seems a necessary correction. 622 racis of mss. I keep: comp. Lucr.
111 929 ‘Consequitur leto’. prae. cap. Inest: the same constr. in Lucr.
111 932, ‘hoc alicui nostrum sic increpct'3 Livy IX 2410 ‘haec obuiis,
haec excurrentibus in publicum pauidis increpat’. 624 namque cet. :
this story of the pious brothers of Catina had extraordinary celebrity:
