Cerberum timeat et tenebras et larualem habitum nudis ossibus cohae-
rentium'. 85 ta of α, changed to ut in other mss, has rendered the
passage unintelligble in all other editions. 86 admittere: Jacob seems
to prove that immittere would be more in place here. Can adm. oe.
alieno eaelo be used as in a phrase like ‘admittere uirum alienae mu-
lieri’2 88 peccet i. e. Iuppiter: see what is said of terret in 84: here
too the preceding plurals have caused the error of mss. 89 Laedam
of α. Ι keep, ae expressing the Greek η; comp. scaena, the usual form in
the older writers. 88—90 comp. Ovid amores 111 12 33 ‘Iuppiter aut
in aues aut se transformat in aurum Aut secat imposita uirgine taurus
aquas'. 91 92, after the precedent of Virgil and contrary to the
usage of the older writers, our author often omits the subst. verb: as
here, and 15 ‘tum gratia ruris⁷, 85 ‘Nec tu..satis’3 also 103, 153,
171, 212, 215, 220, 221, 243, 254 etc.-: yet under restrictions, appa-
rently much the same as we find in Virgil : see Wagner quaest. Virg. xv.
94—15'7 : the earth is not solid, but full of cavities: the fact is cer-
tain, though various causes may be assigned: how else could great rivers
suddenly disappear into it, or rise out of it? In these closed cavities
there is free room for winds to move about: this we can see for ourselves
in large underground hollows, full of wind. The more then they are ¹
shut up in these omines, the fiercer are both wind and fire: they some-
times break through and thus occasion earthquakes. 95 incingyiturof α,
confirming Aldus, is the only true reading: Scaliger in vain assails it
as ‘ab ignaro homine et imperito suppositum’. 96-98 comp. Seu.
nat. quaest. v 14 1 ‘non tota solido contextu terra in imum usque fun·
datur, sed multis partibus caua ec caecis suspensa latebris'. 98 utque
animanti, an unusual rhythm for the age of our poem: so 495 ulteriores,
496 et succernens, end two consecutive vss.: 453 lapidem esse molarem.
99 Per tota pere: for this construction comp. Lucr. vl 668 and Lach.
p. 367: the simple accus is usual. 100 Ad uitam seems to be joined
with what precedes: ‘to maintain life’. sanquis: the only quantity
known to Lucretius: though commonly short in and after the Augustam
age, it is long more than once in Ovid, Lucan, Silius 3 and once in
Virgil, Tibullus, Seneca, Val. Flaccus. 102-117 a long involved
sentence, giving the various ways in which the cavernous nature of the
earth might be explained: 102 aab is answered irregularly in 110 siue,
then 112 seu, 114 aut, 115 siae: Jacob well compares the similarly
involved sentence in Manil. 1 122 foll.: 122 Quem siue, 125 Seu, 128
Siue, 132 Siue, 135 Sea, 137 Aut—<lividing into mque—nec—nec-Aut
—que—Et—que: Manilius too is discussing a similar question. 102
—110 the earth either had this cavernous nature at its first formation.
