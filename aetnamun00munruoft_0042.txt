and the Illyrian passes; the tyranny of Gaius had not been able
to force him to abandon Gaetulicus, nor the freedmen of Claudius
made him unfaithful to other friends, Seneca whose letters appear to
have been written in old age, calls him a ‘iuuenis’ in contrast with 111111-
self, But as he must have arrived at years of discretion in 39, when
Gaetulicus perished, he must have passed the age of forty some years
before Seneca’s death. Seneca speaks of his philos‹‘›phical tastvs, and
these are sufficiently proved by the whole tenour of their correspondencc.
He also calls him ‘my poet' and cites several of his verses3 and in the
79th letter, of which we have already spoken, he alludes to Lucilius'
design of describing Etna in his poem, a trite topic with poets, as Ovid
had done after Virgil, Severus after Ovid: ‘aut ego te non noui aut
Aetna tibi saliuam mouet: iam cupis grande aliquid et par prioribus
scribere’. This passage implies that Etna was to form an episode in
some poem, as it had done in the Aeneid, the metamorphoses and the
work of Cornelius Severus, and would seem at first sight to oppose the
claims of Lucilius as much as those of Severus. But there is this
difference: the poem of Severus was already written, that of Lucilius
was not, and as his materials and interest in the subject increased, he
may have chosen to write an independent work on E1na. &Vould then -
the age of our poem agree with that of Lucilius? exactly, Ι think: for I
have no doubt it belongs to the silver age. When it is freed from the
barbarous rhythms introduced into it by Scaliger, Gorallus, &Vernsdorf
and Jacob, its technical style is exactly that of Lucan and other poets
who formed themselves on the model of Ovid3 and I cannot but think
it was written before Val. Flaccus, Statius and Silius had set the fa-shion
of slavishly copying Virgil's thoughts and language: our poem, small as
its virtues are, is independent enough on the whole in its matter and
manner. That Lucilius was fond of Ovid would appear from Seneca
nat. quaest. IV 2 2 ‘quare non cum poeta meo iocor et illi Ouidium suum
impingo'. It contains however Ι think still more positive evidence of
its age: Wernsdorf has noted that the artifici-al Triton mentioned in
293 seems to allude to a mechanical contrivanoe of the age of Claudius 3
and he and Jacob allege this as a certain proof that the poem was not
written before this time. Vei-y likely the poet may allude to this very
machine 3 but this is by no means certain, as I have shewn in my notes
to the passage that similar Tritons, as well as water-organs, are described
by Heron of Alexandria long before. Again the writer, anxious to
illustrate his subject in every way, carefully describes all the extinct or
nearly extinct volcanoes he knows, those of the Aeolian islands, Ischia,
and the region between Naples and Cumae which he had himself 111-
spected. If then the ‘Vesaeui Hesperiae letalis apex’ had, when he
wrote, already burst on the astonished world, lie could not possibly have
